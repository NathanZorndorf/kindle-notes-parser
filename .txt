Quote: "If happiness always depends on something expected in the future, we are chasing a will-o’-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp, until the future, and ourselves, vanish into the abyss of death."
Note: good quote


Note: good excercise, but its not just family, it is socoety and school too


Quote: "On a separate piece of paper or journal, write down or illustrate the messages you received in your family that seemed to imply that it wasn't OK for you to be who you were, just as you were."
Note: truth


Quote: "In an agrarian society, boys connected with their fathers by working alongside them in the fields. This often meant contact with extended family that included grandfathers, uncles, and cousins. This daily contact with men provided boys with an intimate model of maleness. Sons learned about being male by watching their dads, just as their own fathers had learned by watching their fathers. As families migrated from rural areas to cities and suburbs after World War II, the contact between fathers and sons diminished significantly. Dads left home in the morning and went to work. Most sons never got to see what their fathers did, let alone have much time to spend with them."
Note: not sure i agree with this


Quote: "I believe the significant number of Nice Guys produced in the '40s, '50s, and '60s is the direct result of mothers, not fathers, teaching their sons how to be male. Consequently, many Nice Guys have adopted a female perspective of masculinity and are comfortable having their manhood defined by women."
Note: i am going to stop laughing at peoples jokes that i do not find funny


Quote: "Go back to the list of approval-seeking behaviors at the beginning of this chapter. Choose one of the ways you try to get external validation and do one of the following: 1) Go on a moratorium from this behavior. Set a period of time to stop doing it. Tell the people around you what you are doing. If you slip, tell a safe person about it. Use the slip as information about why, in that particular moment, you felt the need to get external approval."
Note: i want to do this


Quote: "Plan a weekend trip to the mountains or beach. If possible, plan a vacation or retreat for a week or longer by yourself to a place where no one knows you. Visit a foreign country by yourself if at all possible. Use this time as an opportunity for self-observation and reflection. Keep a journal."
Note: OMG nicolia


Quote: "Nice Guys have an uncanny knack of picking partners who, because of childhood sexual abuse or other negative experiences with sex, tend to have a difficult time being sexually expressive."
Note: possibky  fruitful excercise 


Quote: "Look over the following list of ways Nice Guys try to create a smooth, problem-free life. Write down an example of how you used each coping mechanism in childhood. Then, next to each, give an example of how you use this strategy to try to control your world in adulthood. Note how each of these behaviors keeps you feeling like a powerless victim. Share this information with a safe person."
Note: good excercise


Quote: "Think about one "gift" from the universe which you initially resisted but can now be seen as a positive stimulus for growth or discovery. Are there any similar gifts in your life right now to which you need to surrender? Share this information with a safe person."
Note: decent excercse


Quote: "Pick one area in your life in which you routinely feel frustrated or out of control. Step back from the situation. Is the difficulty you are having with the situation the result of you trying to project the reality you want to believe onto it? If you had to accept the reality of this situation, how might you change your response to it?"
Note: probably what i do. i say i fear the power i ave over other people but maybe i fear the power other people bave over me? maybe i gve people that power. 


Quote: "I frequently hear Nice Guys rationalize the withholding of their feelings by claiming they don't want to hurt anyone. The truth is they are covering their own butts. What they are really saying is that they don't want to do anything that might recreate their childhood experiences. They're really not trying to protect anyone from harm, they're just trying to keep their world smooth and under control."
Note: this is a good one. it is ess assertive and therefore just another defense mechanism


Quote: "Don't use feeling words to describe what you are thinking, as in "I feel like Joe was trying to take advantage of me.""
Note: use th word feeling for what i feel and the word thinking for what i think


Quote: "Instead, pay attention to what you are experiencing in your body: "I'm feeling helpless and frightened.""
Note: agree


Quote: "Try to avoid the crutch of saying "I feel like." As in "I feel like you are being mean to me.""
Note: lol thats his great advice on how to face fear? mantra + exposure therapy? hardly innovative


Quote: "List one fear that has been controlling your life. Once you decide to confront the fear, begin repeating to yourself, "I can handle it. No matter what happens, I will handle it." Keep repeating this mantra until you take action and stop feeling fear."
Note: what having integrity and being a mn is bout to me.


Quote: "Only by asking himself what he believes is right and then doing it does he become a man of integrity."
Note: good excercise


Quote: "Before you can start setting boundaries, you have to become aware of how much you back up from your line to avoid conflict or to keep the peace. For the next week, observe yourself. Do you say "yes" when you would rather say "no"? Do you agree to do something to avoid conflict? Do you avoid doing something because someone might get upset at you? Do you tolerate an intolerable situation, hoping that it will just go away? Write these observations down and share them with a safe person."
Note: i ttlhought/think im ifferent becaus im not an asshole or a creep. in reality i act in ways that cause people to label me as both those things anyway.


Quote: "Look over the list above. Note the ways you have consciously or unconsciously tried to be different from your father and/or other men. How does the belief that you are different keep you disconnected from other men?"
Note: shiiiiit lets see


Quote: "List three men whom you would like to get to know better. Next to each man's name list a possible activity you could do together. Next to this, write down a date and make a commitment to contact him by this day."
Note: nice guy?


Quote: "The problem was that he meant really well. That’s the thing, he just meant really well."
Note: fuck i never had that and im jelly. i had other good times though but was always a geek.


Quote: "I stayed leaning in the doorway, remembering the basement parties I’d attended in eighth grade. When we’d sip on Evian bottles of vodka and gag through truth or dare."
Note: good clarification


Quote: "faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception."
Note: good quote


Quote: "After all, the future is quite meaningless and unimportant unless, sooner or later, it is going to become the present. Thus to plan for a future which is not going to become present is hardly more absurd than to plan for a future which, when it comes to me, will find me “absent,” looking fixedly over its shoulder instead of into its face."
Note: funny


Quote: "It has given us the power to control the future but a little—the price of which is the frustration of knowing that we must at last go down in defeat. If we find this absurd, this is only to say that nature has conceived intelligence in us to berate itself for absurdity. Consciousness seems to be nature’s ingenious mode of self-torture."
Note: so true 


Quote: "The clash between science and religion has not shown that religion is false and science is true. It has shown that all systems of definition are relative to various purposes, and that none of them actually “grasp” reality. And because religion was being misused as a means for actually grasping and possessing the mystery of life, a certain measure of “debunking” was highly necessary."
Note: the information age has put us out of touch with our instinct


Quote: "Specialization in verbiage, classification, and mechanized thinking has put man out of touch with many of the marvelous powers of “instinct” which govern his body."
Note: man can know the rigt choice


Quote: "Almost every spiritual tradition recognizes that a point comes when two things must happen: man must surrender his separate-feeling “I,” and must face the fact that he cannot know, that is, define the ultimate."
Note: thi ishy i started to o crazy after 4acodmt. defining things asking questions whose nswers brought more questions that led in a cirle pinning in an infitinite while loop that ha no exit unles istopped asking the poontless quustion regardig lifes prpse, what i should be doing.


Quote: "We can’t go on defining things indefinitely without going round in circles. To define means to fix, and, when you get down to it, real life isn’t fixed.”"
Note: like eistein said the brain is the tool nd the heart is the aster, or something like that


Quote: "The answer to this, and many similar questions, is that we have been taught to neglect, despise, and violate our bodies, and to put all faith in our brains."
Note: this is what i do in game. this the perversion that we as men and women need to become aware of


Quote: "As a consequence, we are at war within ourselves—the brain desiring things which the body does not want, and the body desiring things which the brain does not allow;"
Note: this is the suerficial physical attraction that i refer to wbich is seperate from sxual attraction


Quote: "As in eating his “eyes are bigger than his stomach,” so in love he judges woman by standards that are largely visual and cerebral rather than sexual and visceral. He is attracted to his partner by the surface gloss, by the film on the skin rather than the real body."
Note: we are slave to clocks and try to artificially contort our biology to them


Quote: "Clocks should not be smashed; they should simply be kept in their place. And they are very much out of place when we try to adapt our biological rhythms of eating, sleeping, evacuation, working, and relaxing to their uniform circular rotation."
Note: theories in iur mind o not match reality ad this causes us anxiety


Quote: "We are perpetually frustrated because the verbal and abstract thinking of the brain gives the false impression of being able to cut loose from all finite limitations."
Note: machines give us the illusion of approachig the infinite. of living in a world where reality matches the ideal models in our mind.


Quote: "The externalized symbol of this way of thinking is that almost entirely rational and inorganic object, the machine, which gives us the sense of being able to approach infinity. For the machine can submit to strains far beyond the capacity of the body, and to monotonous rhythms which the human being could never stand."
Note: technolgy has distanced us from our nature.


Quote: "activities which largely boil down to counting and measuring, living in a world of rationalized abstraction which has little relation to or harmony with the great biological rhythms and processes."
Note: the brain as to e the tool with which we use to navigate the present, as opposed to letting ourselves be caught up in te predictions of the future which the brin is not very good at anyway


Quote: "For the brain, including its reasoning and calculating centers, is a part and product of the body. It is as natural as the heart and stomach, and, rightly used, is anything but an enemy of man. But to be used rightly it must be put in its place, for the brain is made for man, not man for his brain. In other words, the function of the brain is to serve the present and the real, not to send man chasing wildly after the phantom of the future."
Note: i cant figure this out but i hve a weird sense that i do know the answer


Quote: "Take for example the anagram POCATELDIMC."
Note: its pointless to demand secuity from a costantly changing and volatile world, but this is exactly what are brain does.


Quote: "It must be obvious, from the start, that there is a contradiction in wanting to be perfectly secure in a universe whose very nature is momentariness and fluidity."
Note: wantig security is a contradiction. the desire fr security is what makes us feel unsecure. 


Quote: "If I want to be secure, that is, protected from the flux of life, I am wanting to be separate from life. Yet it is this very sense of separateness which makes me feel insecure. To be secure means to isolate and fortify the “I,” but it is just the feeling of being an isolated “I” which makes me feel lonely and afraid. In other words, the more security I can get, the more I shall want."
Note: there exists the ideal self that i am currently not, and ten there s the actual self that i cant help but be. trying to reconcile the to causes stress. but there must be a way to move torwards the ideal self while accepting what i am in the moment.


Quote: "I can only think seriously of trying to live up to an ideal, to improve myself, if I am split in two pieces. There must be a good “I” who is going to improve the bad “me.” “I,” who has the best intentions, will go to work on wayward “me,” and the tussle between the two will very much stress the difference between them. Consequently “I” will feel more separate than ever, and so merely increase the lonely and cut-off feelings which make “me” behave so badly."
Note: this is pretty much what i realized on shrooms. the only way out f stress and anxiety is to dive into your fear. 


Quote: "You want to escape from pain, but the more you struggle to escape, the more you inflame the agony. You are afraid and want to be brave, but the effort to be brave is fear trying to run away from itself."
Note: saying yu shojld not feel a certin way is harmful


Quote: "Yet it is perfectly useless to say that we should not want to be safe. Calling a desire bad names doesn’t get rid of it. What we have to discover is that there is no safety, that seeking it is painful, and that when we imagine that we have found it, we don’t like it."
Note: memories are just constructions in our mind that we make up in the present.


Quote: "But, as a matter of fact, you cannot compare this present experience with a past experience. You can only compare it with a memory of the past, which is a part of the present experience."
Note: good


Quote: "The key is understanding. To ask how to do this, what is the technique or method, what are the steps and rules, is to miss the point utterly. Methods are for creating things which do not yet exist. We are concerned here with understanding something which is—the present moment. This is not a psychological or spiritual discipline for self-improvement. It is simply being aware of this present experience, and realizing that you can neither define it nor divide yourself from it. There is no rule but “Look!”"
Note: exploration is here the greatest expernces come frome. 


Quote: "If we are open only to discoveries which will accord with what we know already, we may as well stay shut."
Note: action will nt result in what we want unless we know wht we want. 


Quote: "If the mind is the directive force behind action, the mind and its vision of life must be healed before action can be anything but conflict."
Note: i feel seperate from the universe because i am seperate from my own self?


Quote: "Nevertheless, the physical reality is that my body exists only in relation to this universe, and in fact I am as attached to it and dependent on it as a leaf on a tree. I feel cut off only because I am split within myself, because I try to be divided from my own feelings and sensations. What I feel and sense therefore seems foreign to me."
Note: this is why after taking acid at emissions i think i was being caught in that infinite while loop


Quote: "In the strictest sense, we cannot actually think about life and reality at all, because this would have to include thinking about thinking, thinking about thinking about thinking, and so ad infinitum."
Note: relates to article on medium


Quote: "The theory that we must inevitably do what gives us the greater pleasure or the lesser pain, is a meaningless assertion based on verbal confusion. To say that I decide to do something because it pleases me says only that I decide to do it because I decide to do it. If “pleasure” is defined in the beginning as “what I prefer,” then what I prefer will always be pleasure. If I prefer pain, like a masochist, then pain will be pleasure. In short, the theory begs the question at the start by saying that pleasure means what we desire:"
Note: all thoguth is circular


Quote: "Definition is simply making a one-to-one correspondence between groups of sense data and noises, but because noises are sense data, the attempt is ultimately circular."
Note: the self will not give it self up. 


Quote: "How can a self, which is selfish, give itself up? Not, say the theologians, by its own power, but through the gift of divine grace, the power which enables man to achieve what is beyond his own strength."
Note: purpose of scince is to us the world as he likes, to undersand i in terms of labels


Quote: "The greater the scientist, the more he is impressed with his ignorance of reality, and the more he realizes that his laws and labels, descriptions and definitions, are the products of his own thought. They help him to use the world for purposes of his own devising rather than to understand and explain it."
Note: christian view that god can only be experienced not known


Quote: "Or there are the words of St. John of the Cross, one of the greatest seers of the Christian tradition: One of the greatest favors bestowed on the soul transiently in this life is to enable it to see so distinctly and to feel so profoundly that it cannot comprehend God at all."
Note: any control you think you hve over your external environmnt is a delusion. you can only influence your envionment, you can not control it.


Quote: "Real Power is the degree to which a person has control over their own circumstances."
Note: i agree with this. a womans imagination is what turns her on, and external influences have an infuence on her imagination


Quote: "A woman’s imagination is the single most useful tool in your Game arsenal."
Note: okay, this might be true, but why?? 


Quote: "Familiarity is anti- seductive. Nothing kills Game, organic passion and libido like comfortable familiarity."
Note: interestig observation/psychological experiment


Quote: "Studies have shown that men have the ability to more quickly and accurately identify their own children in a room full of kids dressed in the same uniforms than the mothers of the child."
Note: fear (of rejection) is whats makes up 90% of the reason guys fail to successfully realize a sexual connection


Quote: "90% of the dilemmas AFCs find themselves in, and a majority of men’s concerns, with the opposite sex find, their roots in the methods and means they use to reduce their exposure to female rejection."
Note: good ways to live: expess your honest feelings. be direct and clear


Quote: "And to help others and be eager to share, not to be a pessimist, and never to doubt your friends’ affection for you. And that when people incurred his disapproval, they always knew it. And that his friends never had to speculate about his attitude to anything: it was always clear."
Note: awesome traits, especially persistence


Quote: "Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he’d reached them. Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence."
Note: fucking critical to life


Quote: "A sense of when to push and when to back off."
Note: LOL


Quote: "Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys."
Note: interesting. know when you are not talented at something.


Quote: "That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up."
Note: he knew the mind is bs


Quote: "Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future."
Note: damn marcus was hella zen


Quote: "The world is maintained by change—in the elements and in the things they compose. That should be enough for you; treat it as an axiom. Discard your thirst for books, so that you won’t die in bitterness, but in cheerfulness and truth, grateful to the gods from the bottom of your heart."
Note: good paragraph


Quote: "Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like"
Note: interesting


Quote: "But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful—and hence neither good nor bad."
Note: so like alan watts


Quote: "dying is—and that if you look at it in the abstract and break down your imaginary ideas of it by logical analysis, you realize that it’s nothing but a process of nature, which only children can be afraid of. (And not only a process of nature but a necessary one.) And how man grasps God, with what part of himself he does so, and how that part is conditioned when he does."
Note: dude marcus was so zen. so many arellels with alan watts.


Quote: "Even if you’re going to live three thousand more years, or ten times that, remember: you cannot lose another life than the one you’re living now, or live another one than the one you’re losing. The longest amounts to the same as the shortest. The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can’t lose either the past or the future; how could you lose what you don’t have?"
Note: wow. that really is a good reason to not fear dying.


Quote: "that the longest-lived and those who will die soonest lose the same thing. The present is all that they can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not"
Note: beauty is all around us 


Quote: "If you look at them in isolation there’s nothing beautiful about them, and yet by supplementing nature they enrich it and draw us in. And anyone with a feeling for nature—a deeper sensitivity—will find it all gives pleasure. Even what seems inadvertent. He’ll find the jaws of live animals as beautiful as painted ones or sculptures. He’ll look calmly at the distinct beauty of old age in men, women, and at the loveliness of children. And other things like that will call out to him constantly—things unnoticed by others. Things seen only by those at home with Nature and its works."
Note: so true. just be concerned with yourself


Quote: "Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about other people—unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You’ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and what they’re saying, and what they’re thinking, and what they’re up to, and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind."
Note: so true. just be concerned with yourself and the common good. not the specific worries of other individuals


Note: have purposeful thoughts


Quote: "You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, “What are you thinking about?” you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones—the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you’d be ashamed to be caught thinking."
Note: i dont agree, but hes tripping. never say nver


Quote: "Never under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, with misgivings."
Note: can i control my thoughts? i have a little control at least


Quote: "Your ability to control your thoughts—treat it with respect."
Note: give no fucks bout what anyone else thinks


Quote: "The tranquillity that comes when you stop caring what they say. Or think, or do. Only what you do. (Is this fair? Is this the right thing to do?)"
Note: i relate so much.


Quote: "Siddhartha had started to nurse discontent in himself, he had started to feel that the love of his father and the love of his mother, and also the love of his friend, Govinda, would not bring him joy for ever and ever, would not nurse him, feed him, satisfy him. He"
Note: that thr question


Quote: "And where was Atman to be found, where did He reside, where did his eternal heart beat, where else but in one's own self, in its innermost part, in its indestructible part, which everyone had in himself? But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?"
Note: once the heart makes its decision it cant be changed


Quote: "Then his father realized that even now Siddhartha no longer dwelt with him in his home, that he had already left him."
Note: 1


Quote: "that I, Siddhartha, find only a short numbing of the senses in my exercises and meditations and that I am just as far removed from wisdom, from salvation, as a child in the mother's womb, this I know, oh Govinda, this I know.""
Note: words bleh


Quote: "But be warned, oh seeker of knowledge, of the thicket of opinions and of arguing about words. There is nothing to opinions, they may be beautiful or ugly, smart or foolish, everyone can support them or discard them."
Note: 2


Quote: "If I merely were one of your disciples, oh venerable one, I'd fear that it might happen to me that only seemingly, only deceptively my self would be calm and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and grow, for then I had replaced my self with the teachings, my duty to follow you, my love for you, and the community of the monks!""
Note: be aware of wisdom. wisdom has gotten me into a lot of trouble nd confusion


Quote: ""You know how to talk wisely, my friend. Be aware of too much wisdom!""
Note: i feel like this is happening to me now. especially as i leave kmi and the country


Quote: "When Siddhartha left the grove, where the Buddha, the perfected one, stayed behind, where Govinda stayed behind, then he felt that in this grove his past life also stayed behind and parted from him."
Note: thats where im at. ive listened to the advice of a lt of people. some of it has helped and some of it has hurt. now i feel ready to trust myself. no one else has the answers for me, i must find them for myself.


Quote: "He realized that one thing had left him, as a snake is left by its old skin, that one thing no longer existed in him, which had accompanied him throughout his youth and used to be a part of him: the wish to have teachers and to listen to teachings. He had also left the last teacher who had appeared"
Note: the struggle.


Quote: ""It was the self, the purpose and essence of which I sought to learn. It was the self, I wanted to free myself from, which I sought to overcome. But I was not able to overcome it, could only deceive it, could only flee from it, only hide from it. Truly, no thing in this world has kept my thoughts thus busy, as this my very own self, this mystery of me being alive, of me being one and being separated and isolated from all others, of me being Siddhartha! And there is no thing in this world I know less about than about me, about Siddhartha!""
Note: i wanto learn from myslf ad learn aboiut me


Quote: "I want to learn from myself, want to be my student, want to get to know myself, the secret of Siddhartha.""
Note: haha but ive had moments like this many times


Quote: "No, this is over, I have awakened, I have indeed awakened and have not been born before this very day.""
Note: alone. without a home, without a culture or clan. without an identity. my old identity is gone. its frightening.


Quote: "Still, even in the deepest meditation, he had been his father's son, had been a Brahman, of a high caste, a cleric. Now, he was nothing but Siddhartha, the awoken one, nothing else was left. Deeply, he inhaled, and for a moment, he felt cold and shivered. Nobody was thus alone as he was. There was no nobleman who did not belong to the noblemen, no worker that did not belong to the workers, and found refuge with them, shared their life, spoke their language. No Brahman, who would not be regarded as Brahmans and lived with them, no ascetic who would not find his refuge in the caste of the Samanas, and even the most forlorn hermit in the forest was not just one and alone, he was also surrounded by a place he belonged to, he also belonged to a caste, in which he was at home. Govinda had become a monk, and a thousand monks were his brothers, wore the same robe as he, believed in his faith, spoke his language. But he, Siddhartha, where did he belong to?"
Note: everyone has access to magic


Quote: "Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas. This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the daemons. Nothing is effected by daemons, there are no daemons. Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast.""
Note: siddhartha learns the ways of the lover


Quote: "she taught, thoroughly starting with the basics, about that school of thought which teaches that pleasure cannot be be taken without giving pleasure, and that every gesture, every caress, every touch, every look, every spot of the body, however small it was, had its secret, which would bring happiness to those who know about it and unleash it."
Note: conducting business always in the present moment


Quote: "But he has that mysterious quality of those people to whom success comes all by itself, whether this may be a good star of his birth, magic, or something he has learned among Samanas. He always seems to be merely playing with out business-affairs, they never fully become a part of him, they never rule over him, he is never afraid of failure, he is never upset by a loss.""
Note: accepting the present


Quote: ""Surely," Siddhartha laughed, "surely I have travelled for my amusement. For what else? I have gotten to know people and places, I have received kindness and trust, I have found friendship. Look, my dear, if I had been Kamaswami, I would have travelled back, being annoyed and in a hurry, as soon as I had seen that my purchase had been rendered impossible, and time and money would indeed have been lost. But like this, I've had a few good days, I've learned, had joy, I've neither harmed myself nor others by annoyance and hastiness."
Note: no point in orrying. thats mind stuff which doesnt exist


Quote: "Siddhartha never listened to Kamaswami's worries and Kamaswami had many worries."
Note: so much pointless pain and hate


Quote: "He saw them toiling, saw them suffering, and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to entirely unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being slightly honoured, he saw them scolding and insulting each other, he saw them complaining about pain at which a Samana would only smile, and suffering because of deprivations which a Samana would not feel."
Note: what im trying to do in europe


Quote: "Siddhartha stayed with the ferryman and learned to operate the boat, and when there was nothing to do at the ferry, he worked with Vasudeva in the rice-field, gathered wood, plucked the fruit off the banana-trees. He learned to build an oar, and learned to mend the boat, and to weave baskets, and was joyful because of everything he learned, and the days and months passed quickly."
Note: hooooo damn. wisdom must be found. cant be passed on from one erson to another


Quote: "wisdom cannot be passed on. Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishness.""
Note: words are not complete! my thought as well. 


Quote: "It says: The opposite of every truth is just as true! That's like this: any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided. Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words, it's all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness, roundness, oneness."
Note: fuckinv words


Quote: "this very stone, and the river, and all these things we are looking at and from which we can learn. I can love a stone, Govinda, and also a tree or a piece of bark. This are things, and things can be loved. But I cannot love words. Therefore, teachings are no good for me, they have no hardness, no softness, no colours, no edges, no smell, no taste, they have nothing but words. Perhaps it are these which keep you from finding peace,"
Note: thoughts snd words are silly


Quote: "I don't differentiate much between thoughts and words. To be honest, I also have no high opinion of thoughts. I have a better opinion of things. Here on this ferry-boat, for instance, a man has"
Note: loveis the most important


Quote: "But I'm only interested in being able to love the world, not to despise it, not to hate it and me, to be able to look upon it and me and all beings with love and admiration and great respect.""
Note: sex s er single best agency eh? i dont think so

Quote: "The account was an artifice, stylizing a process of discovery actually carried out over years, on odd occasions, sometimes below the level of consciousness and computation. A prism in a pencil-thin sunbeam actually makes a smudge of color on a wall, uneven and unstable, its edges shadowy and fading. He idealized what he described; the image made sense only because he already knew what he was looking for. He had already seen, years before, that blue light is bent more than red; he had looked through a prism at red and blue threads and noted their varying refraction. He also knew that refracting lenses smeared colors; that was why he had invented a reflecting telescope."

Quote: "this was mere conjecture. He wrote: “To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. Tis much better to do a little with certainty & leave the rest for others that come after you.”"


Quote: "In human freedom in the philosophical sense I am definitely a disbeliever. Everybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance with inner necessity. Schopenhauer’s saying, that “a man can do as he will, but not will as he will,” has been an inspiration to me since my youth up, and a continual consolation and unfailing well-spring of patience in the face of the hardships of life, my own and others’."


Quote: "The ideals which have lighted me on my way and time after time given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. Without the sense of fellowship with men of like mind, of preoccupation with the objective, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific research, life would have seemed to me empty."


Quote: "One is sharply conscious, yet without regret, of the limits to the possibility of mutual understanding and sympathy with one’s fellow-creatures."


Quote: "mystery-even if mixed with fear-that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms-it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude;"


Quote: "am convinced that every man who reads Herr Gumbel’s books with an open mind will get the same impression from them as I have. Men like him are needed"


Quote: "WHEN WE SURVEY our lives and endeavours we soon observe that almost the whole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings. We see that our whole nature resembles that of the social animals."


Quote: "Without creative, independently thinking and judging personalities the upward development of society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual personality without the nourishing soil of the community."


Quote: "Not till we are lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations."


Quote: "But, wherever a man goes, men will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions, and, if they can, constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society."


Quote: "I am convinced, that if all men were to live as simply as I then did, thieving and robbery would be unknown.These take place only in communities where some have got more than is sufficient while others have not enough."

Quote: "In such a day, in September or October, Walden is a perfect forest mirror, set round with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer or rarer. Nothing so fair, so pure, and at the same time so large, as a lake, perchance, lies on the surface of the earth. Sky water. It needs no fence. Nations come and go without defiling it. It is a mirror which no stone can crack, whose quicksilver will never wear off, whose gilding Nature continually repairs; no storms, no dust, can dim its surface ever fresh; — a mirror in which all impurity presented to it sinks, swept and dusted by the sun’s hazy brush — this the light dust-cloth — which retains no breath that is breathed on it, but sends its own to float as clouds high above its surface, and be reflected in its bosom still."

Quote: "Fishermen, hunters, woodchoppers, and others, spending their lives in the fields and woods, in a peculiar sense a part of Nature themselves, are often in a more favorable mood for observing her, in the intervals of their pursuits, than philosophers or poets even, who approach her with expectation."

This was my answer with respect to those youths who were bent on this pursuit, trusting that they would soon outgrow it. No humane being, past the thoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly murder any creature which holds its life by the same tenure that he does.The"
Note: thoreau was a vegetarisn 


Quote: "Beside, there is something essentially unclean about this diet and all flesh, and I began to see where housework commences, and whence the endeavor, which costs so much, to wear a tidy and respectable appearance each day, to keep the house sweet and free from all ill odors and sights. Having been my own butcher and scullion and cook, as well as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up, I can speak from an unusually complete experience. The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially."


Quote: "The repugnance to animal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct."


Quote: "I believe that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly inclined to abstain from animal food, and from much food of any kind."


Quote: "Whatever my own practice may be, I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized."


Quote: "It is neither the quality nor the quantity, but the devotion to sensual savors; when that which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal, or inspire our spiritual life, but food for the worms that possess us."


Quote: "“A command over our passions, and over the external senses of the body, and good acts, are declared by the Ved to be indispensable in the mind’s approximation to God.”"
Note: did his chastity resilt of his philosophy or was it the other way around


Quote: "Chastity is the flowering of man; and what are called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like, are but various fruits which succeed it."


Quote: "All sensuality is one, though it takes many forms; all purity is one. It is the same whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep sensually. They are but one appetite, and we only need to see a person do any one of these things to know how great a sensualist he is."


Quote: "What avails it that you are Christian, if you are not purer than the heathen, if you deny yourself no more, if you are not more religious?"
Note: hmm maybe different peeple served different roles. maybee your wife was just the person yu were sexually attracted to, and ypu got intelletual and evve emotional onnection and fufillment from other people in your life. 


Quote: "For most of the history of our species, courtship and marriage weren’t really about two individuals finding love and fulfillment."


Quote: "According to the historian Stephanie Coontz, author of Marriage, a History, until recently a marital union was primarily important for establishing a bond between two families. It was about achieving security—financial, social, and personal. It was about creating conditions that made it possible to survive and reproduce."
Note: ok so maybee it was als about being a team for the period off human history when families formmed teamms centered around a farm.  but hunter gatherers worked as a triab team, so thjere wohuld not be a need to fulfill work needs through marriage.


Quote: "In the past, a guy would be thinking, Oh, shit, I gotta have kids to work on my farm. I need four-year-old kids performing manual labor ASAP. And I need a woman who can make me clothes. I better get on this. A woman would think, I better find a dude who’s capable on the farm and good with a plow so I don’t starve and die."


Quote: "Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long. So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide: Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort, give me edge. Give me novelty, give me familiarity. Give me predictability, give me surprise. And we think it’s a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.6"


Quote: "Smith’s views about work guided the father of what came to be called the “scientific management” movement, Frederick Winslow Taylor."


Quote: "It is in the inherent interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can; and if his emoluments are to be precisely the same whether he does or does not perform some very laborious duty, to perform it in as careless and slovenly a manner that authority will permit."


Quote: "One man draws out the wire, another straits it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head . . . I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed. . . . They could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins a day. . . . But if they had all wrought separately and independently . . . they certainly could not, each of them, make twenty."
Note: too simplistic


Quote: "Adam Smith was mistaken about our attitudes and aspirations regarding work. But as capitalism developed in his shadow, under the sway of the “incentive theory of everything,” a mode of work evolved in which all the other satisfactions that might come from it were neglected or eliminated. And so it came to be that all over the planet, people trudged off to work each day with little expectation of meaning, engagement, or challenge. Because there was no reason to work except for the paycheck, they worked for the paycheck."
Note: discretion over HOW to do your job is huge in satisfaction and productivity annd innovation


Quote: "What is it that enabled Luke to do work like this? First, Luke’s job gave him broad discretion when it came to social interactions with the patients. He didn’t have a supervisor looking over his shoulder every minute."
Note: being engaged, challenged, and having talents or skills that you can use and enjoy using in overcoming these challeenges 


Quote: "Further, the challenge of getting these social interactions right was engaging. Meeting the challenge demanded empathy, good listening, and the perceptiveness to know when to stay in the background and when to come forward, when to joke and when to comfort. Having the skills to do this work well made Luke’s day. And it likely helped to make the patients’ days better as well."
Note: work has to be meaningful as well


Quote: "Finally, Luke believed in the purposes of the enterprise of which he was a part."


Quote: "Why would anyone forbid people to work the way Luke and Carlotta work? One reason is efficiency."


Quote: "A second reason is the desire on the part of managers for control."


Quote: "“Something I have to say in defense of the young folks today is that there’s just so many choices out there,” one mom said. “When I was growing up, there was a mixer and there was a bar, and that was about it. But now—my god. I would really hate to be single nowadays.”"


Quote: "The older folks weren’t buying it. They understood that they had had fewer options when they were growing up, but, intriguingly, they didn’t seem to regret having fewer choices."


Quote: "one woman explained, “You didn’t think about the choices you had. When you found someone you liked, you jumped into a relationship."

Quote: "Don’t text back right away. You come off like a loser who has nothing going on. • If you write to someone, don’t text them again until you hear from them. • The amount of text you write should be of a similar length to what the other person has written to you. • Carrying this through, if your messages are in blue and the other person’s messages are green, if there is a shit ton more blue than green in your conversation, this person doesn’t give a shit about you. • The person who receives the last message in a convo WINS!"

Quote: "Which sounds stupid, but the way I see it, he and I both know the other is glued to their phone. Everyone is. So if you’re gonna play the game, that’s fine, but I’ll play it better. Very competitive.” DAMN. Several people subscribed to the notion of doubling the response time. (They write back in five minutes, you wait ten, etc.) This way you achieve the upper hand and constantly seem busier and less available than your counterpart. Others thought waiting just a few minutes was enough to prove you had something important in your life besides your phone. Some thought you should double but occasionally throw in a quick response to not seem so regimented (nothing too long, though!). Some people swore by waiting 1.25 times longer. Others argued they found three minutes to be just right. There were also those who were so fed up with the games that they thought receiving timely"

Quote: "In this sense, Tinder actually isn’t so different from what our grandparents did, nor is the way my friend used online dating to find someone Jewish who lived nearby. In a world of infinite possibilities, we’ve cut down our options to people we’re attracted to in our neighborhood."
Note: this is a good insight but i already  knew it


Quote: "At certain times, though, this “I need the best” mentality can be debilitating. I wish I could just eat somewhere that looks good and be happy with my choice. But I can’t. The problem is that I know somewhere there is a perfect meal for me and I have to do however much research I can to find it. That’s the thing about the Internet: It doesn’t simply help us find the best thing out there; it has helped to produce the idea that there is a best thing and, if we search hard enough, we can find it. And in turn there are a whole"
Note: wrong


Quote: "Initially, we are attracted to people by their physical appearance and traits we can quickly recognize. But the things that really make us fall for someone are their deeper, more unique qualities, and usually those only come out during sustained interactions."

Quote: "Hence, the importance of identifying your highest strengths and learning to use them more often in order to go into flow (www.authentichappiness.org)."


Quote: "(in jargon, “defines exhaustively” is called “operationalizes”),"


Quote: "each element of well-being must itself have three properties to count as an element: 1. It contributes to well-being. 2. Many people pursue it for its own sake, not merely to get any of the other elements. 3. It is defined and measured independently of the other elements (exclusivity)."
Note: so then do people seek relationships too giive theiir lif meaning? even if they dont consciously do that 


Quote: "today it is accepted without dissent that connections to other people and relationships are what give meaning and purpose to life."


Quote: "Here is the exercise: find one wholly unexpected kind thing to do tomorrow and just do it. Notice what happens to your mood."


Quote: "the big brain is a social problem solver, not a physical problem solver."


Quote: "So the big brain is a relationship simulation machine, and it has been selected by evolution for exactly the function of designing and carrying out harmonious but effective human relationships."


Quote: "In well-being theory, these twenty-four strengths underpin all five elements, not just engagement: deploying your highest strengths leads to more positive emotion, to more meaning, to more accomplishment, and to better relationships."


Quote: "Public policy aimed only at subjective well-being is vulnerable to the Brave New World caricature in which the government promotes happiness simply by drugging the population with a euphoriant called “soma.”"


Quote: "This kind of study leads to the “moon-shot” goal for positive psychology, which is what the final chapter is about and what this book is really aimed at. As our ability to measure positive emotion, engagement, meaning, accomplishment, and positive relations improves, we can ask with rigor how many people in a nation, in a city, or in a corporation are flourishing. We can ask with rigor when in her lifetime an individual is flourishing. We can ask with rigor if a charity is increasing the flourishing of its beneficiaries. We can ask with rigor if our school systems are helping our children flourish."
Note: can wee really know the consequences of an action especiakky a large action on peoples weell being?


Quote: "We can ask if a program of vaccination for measles will produce more flourishing than an equally expensive corneal transplant program. We can ask by how much a program of paying parents to take extra time at home raising their children increases flourishing."

Note: its not trivial. thats the question thats important for me, even if you know what affects well being, can you affect it in a positive way with any reliability?

Quote: "Every night for the next week, set aside ten minutes before you go to sleep. Write down three things that went well today and why they went well. You may use a journal or your computer to write about the events, but it is important that you have a physical record of what you wrote."

Quote: "Signature Strengths Exercise The purpose of this exercise is to encourage you to own your signature strengths by finding new and more frequent uses for them."


Quote: "A signature strength has the following hallmarks: • A sense of ownership and authenticity (“This is the real me”) • A feeling of excitement while displaying it, particularly at first • A rapid learning curve as the strength is first practiced • A sense of yearning to find new ways to use it • A feeling of inevitability in using the strength (“Try to stop me”) • Invigoration rather than exhaustion while using the strength • The creation and pursuit of personal projects that revolve around it • Joy, zest, enthusiasm, even ecstasy while using it"

Quote: "The brave person is able to uncouple the emotional and behavioral components of fear, resisting the behavioral response of flight and facing the fearful situation despite the discomfort produced by subjective and physical reactions. Fearlessness, boldness, and rashness are not valor; it is facing danger, despite fear, that marks valor."

Quote: "“We go into companies and transcribe every word that is said in their business meetings. We have done this in sixty companies. One-third of the companies are flourishing economically, one-third are doing okay, and one-third are failing. We code each sentence for positive or negative words, and then we take a simple ratio of positive to negative statements. “There is a sharp dividing line,” Barb continued. “Companies with better than a 2.9:1 ratio for positive to negative statements are flourishing. Below that ratio, companies are not doing well economically. We call this the ‘Losada ratio,’ named after my Brazilian colleague Marcel Losada, who discovered this fact."


Quote: "“But don’t go overboard with positivity. Life is a ship with sails and rudder. Above 13:1, without a negative rudder, the positive sails flap aimlessly, and you lose your credibility.”"

Note: yes but isnt the "realty of yhe danger" subjective and not objetive?


Quote: "Negative emotions warn us about a specific threat: when we feel fear, it is almost always preceded by a thought of danger. When we feel sad, there is almost always a thought of loss. When we feel angry, there is almost always a thought of trespass. This leaves us room to pause and identify what is going on when our negative emotional reaction is out of proportion to the reality of the danger, loss, or trespass out there. Then we can modulate our emotional reaction into proportion. This is the essence of cognitive therapy, but in a preventive mode."


Quote: "Building a robust Losada ratio (more positive thoughts than negative) by having positive emotions more frequently builds psychological and social capital."
Note: yeah but im really skeptical that i or anyone can actually enginee their life so that they jeep themselves in situations that make them haoy

Quote: "I am all for realism when there is a knowable reality out there that is not influenced by your expectations. When your expectations influence reality, realism sucks."


Quote: "As the measurement of well-being has become an acceptable if not yet a wholly respectable endeavor in social science, there are those, led by my friend Richard Layard, who advocate that the common metric should be happiness—being in a good mood and judging your life as satisfying. We would then evaluate policy by how much happiness it brings."


Quote: "The first problem is that happiness is a wholly subjective target, and it lacks objective measures. Positive relationships, meaning, and accomplishment have both objective and subjective components: not just how you feel about your relationships, but how these people feel about you; not just your sense of meaning (you could be deluded), but the degree to which you actually belong to and actually serve something larger than you are; not just your pride in what you have done, but whether you have actually met your goals, and where these goals stand in their impact on the people you care about and on the world."


Quote: "The second problem of using just the happiness metric for policy is that it undercounts the vote of half of the world—introverts and low-positive-affective people. Introverts, on average, do not feel as much positive emotion and do not feel as great elation as extraverts feel when they make a new friend or tour a national park."

Quote: "Having heard the student, the solicitors went off to do their excruciating jobs. Miraculously, their performance was transformed. They made more calls per hour, and got many more contributions, than did a comparable group of solicitors who had not heard the student. Same job. Same pay. But inspired by seeing the effects of their efforts vividly portrayed, twice as effective. Such is the power of giving work meaning and significance."
Note: lol you cant make that generalization


Quote: "But now we’ve seen that custodians, carpet factory workers, hairdressers, and phone solicitors can find an equal level of meaning and fulfillment."


Quote: "To have a job that you are happy—even eager—to do, it helps if the work itself is challenging, varied, and engaging."


Quote: "It helps if the work gives you the chance to use your skills and develop more skills. It helps if you have discretion over how you do your job. It helps if you feel that you are part of a group, with fellow workers you respect. And most important, it helps if the work is aimed at a goal that is valuable and gives the work you do meaning and purpose."
Note: challenging, varied, engaging, meaningful, with positive relationships, skill based

Note: challenging, varied, engaging, meaningful, with positive relationships, skill based. but can you make routine  jobs like this? 


Quote: "Whereas good work need not have all of these positive characteristics, this last one—a sense of higher purpose—may be close to indispensable."
Note: that seems like simplifying the issue


Quote: "So it is possible that if people bring the right attitude to their work, almost any job can provide satisfaction, and if they don’t bring the right attitude, no job will provide satisfaction."


Quote: "Management expert Jeffrey Pfeffer laid it all out in his book The Human Equation. Pfeffer’s book was not concerned especially with asking what it takes to create workplaces in which people thrive. He was asking what it takes to create workplaces that succeed—that make for growing, sustainably profitable companies. But based on his analysis of many companies in many different lines of business, what makes for successful companies overlaps substantially with what makes for good work."


Quote: "In his words, a good company nurtures “high commitment” workers, and high commitment workers care about doing their jobs well."


Quote: "They provide a high degree of employment security, which builds employee loyalty and trust."


Quote: "They rely on self-managed teams and decentralized decision-making. That is, employees are given a lot of discretion and autonomy."


Quote: "They pay more than the market demands, which makes employees feel valued. But they don’t rely very much on individual incentives to induce people to work hard. When the company does well, all employees benefit through some form of gain sharing. They’re all in it together."


Quote: "They provide extensive training, both when people start to work and as an ongoing process. This training represents a significant investment in employees, which again builds loyalty and trust. And continued training means that employees keep facing new challenges and developing new skills."


Quote: "Japan spends an average of 364 hours training each new employee, Europe spends 178, and the United States spends 21."


Quote: "They measure employee performance, but they don’t overmeasure employee performance, trusting that their employees will want to do right by"


Quote: "They put great emphasis on the company mission, not just in occasional speeches by the CEO, but in day-to-day practices up and down the organization."


Quote: "when people are in states of positive emotion, they think expansively and creatively. They are in what Fredrickson calls a “broaden and build” mode of engagement with the world. When people are in states of negative emotion, in contrast, they hunker down defensively, worried about making mistakes or going wrong."


Quote: "when we’re not under threat, and get satisfaction from the work we do, our positive emotional state will enable us to do better work, which in turn will create more positive emotion, which in turn will promote even better work, and so"
Note: hmmmm i suppose


Quote: "Market theory tells us that each transaction is what is called “positive-sum.” In other words, both the buyer and the seller of goods or services gains from the transaction."

Quote: "what that means is that virtually every job that people do can be made meaningful by focusing on the ways in which it improves the lives of customers, as long as it’s done right and done well."


Quote: "The two standard methods for managing disinterested workers are material incentives (wages) and close monitoring of work that has been routinized. Carrots and sticks. What is striking is that, in the analysis that Pfeffer offers, both of these tools have negative effects on employee engagement and work satisfaction."
Note: what??? but in all examples you cite, you had made no conscious choice to improve yohr job, you were placed in a job you didnt like (and that didnt change, you didnt try to adjust your attitude or anything) or you were placed in a job you did like.. theres nothing radical about that. 


Quote: "The lesson I draw—half a century later—from my varied summer work experiences is that it needn’t take a lot to turn bad work into good."
Note: you didnt turn your bad work situation into a good one 


Quote: "And it needn’t take a lot to turn good work into bad."
Note: okay lets ee


Quote: "Here, we’ll investigate how we can turn good work into bad work, largely as a result of the mistaken assumption that the people who are working don’t want to be there, and thus have to be carefully monitored and incentivized to do their work."
Note: i could have told yoy that without a big analysis. thats the thing. so much of psychology is obvious. but s the not so obvious that interests me 


Quote: "In a comprehensive article about the significance of salary to job satisfaction, Timothy Judge and colleagues reviewed the results of eighty-six studies that included about fifteen thousand employees. Their analysis of the data from all these studies combined suggested that level of pay had very little effect on either job satisfaction or pay satisfaction."


Quote: "When you create an environment in which workers are respected, they want to be there and they want to work."

Quote: "When Melville took his son on walks, he would turn over stones and tell him about the ants and the worms or the stars and the waves. He favored process over facts. His desire to explain such things often outstripped his knowledge of them; much later Feynman recognized that his father must have invented sometimes. The gift of these lessons, as Feynman expressed it in his two favorite stories about his father, was a way of thinking about scientific knowledge. One was the story about birds. Fathers and sons often walked together on summer weekends in the Catskill Mountains of New York, and one day a boy said to Richard, “See that bird? What kind of bird is that?” I said, “I haven’t the slightest idea what kind of bird it is.” He says, “It’s a brown-throated thrush. Your father doesn’t teach you anything!” But it was the opposite. He had already taught me: “See that bird?” he says. “It’s a Spencer’s warbler.” (I knew he didn’t know the real name.) “Well, in Italian, it’s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it’s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it’s a Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese, it’s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places and what they call the bird. So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing—that’s what counts.”"


Quote: "“We have to renounce a description of phenomena based on the concept of cause and effect.”"

Quote: "Occasionally Richard went on dates with other girls. He could never rid himself of a sense that he was a stranger engaging in a ritual the rules to which he did not know."


Quote: "His mother taught him some basic manners. Even so, the waiting in a girl’s parlor with her parents, the procedures for cutting in at dances, the stock phrases (“Thank you for a lovely evening”) all left him feeling inept, as if he could not quite decipher a code everyone else had mastered."
Note: not anymore. knowledge is everywhere but still it is not common to seek it out, but its less common to contribute original thoughts or reations to the world 


Quote: "Knowledge was rarer then. A secondhand magazine was an occasion. For a Far Rockaway teenager merely to find a mathematics textbook took will and enterprise. Each radio program, each telephone call, each lecture in a local synagogue, each movie at the new Gem theater on Mott Avenue carried the weight of something special."


Quote: "Despite the Depression the institute had completed a new physics and chemistry laboratory with money from the industrialist George Eastman."


Quote: "Wolfgang Pauli once complained, “Our friend Dirac, too, has a religion, and its guiding principle is ‘There is no God and Dirac is His prophet.’”"


Quote: "René Descartes wrote in his Principles of Philosophy: There cannot be any atoms or parts of matter which are indivisible of their own nature (as certain philosophers have imagined).... For though God had rendered the particle so small that it was beyond the power of any creature to divide it, He could not deprive Himself of the power of division, because it was absolutely impossible that He should lessen His own omnipotence...."
Note: different models  for different scales. at one scale  model might be fairly accurate but at a larger or finer scale that same model has large error margins


Quote: "There was no special providence in the fall of a sparrow; just Newton’s second law, f = ma. Forces, masses, and acceleration were the same everywhere."


Quote: "No matter what forces are at work, a planet somehow chooses the cheapest, the simplest, the best of all possible paths."


Quote: "Joseph Louis Lagrange, showed that the paths of moving objects are always, in a special sense, the most economical. They are the paths that minimize a quantity called action—a quantity based on the object’s velocity, its mass, and the space it traverses. No matter what forces are at work, a planet somehow chooses the cheapest, the simplest, the best of all possible paths."
Note: not only this but there is order everywhere. but there is also chaos. ...


Quote: "is almost impossible for a physicist to talk about the principle of least action without inadvertently imputing some kind of volition to the projectile. The ball seems to choose its path. It seems to know all the possibilities in advance."


Quote: "The hard question remained. (In fact, it would remain, disquieting the few physicists who continued to ponder it, until Feynman, having long since overcome his aversion to the principle of least action, found the answer in quantum mechanics.) Park phrased the question simply: How does the ball know which path to choose?"


Quote: "Some administrators and students did worry about the socialization of this famously awkward creature. One medicine prescribed by the masters of student life was Tea, compulsory for all freshmen. (“But after they have conquered their initial fears and learned to balance a cup on a saucer while conversing with the wife of a professor, compulsion is no longer necessary.”)"


Quote: "By then Dick had decided that alcohol made him stupid. He avoided it with unusual earnestness."


Quote: "he managed to write an essay on the limitations of reason: problems in art or ethics, he argued, could not be settled with certainty through chains of logical reasoning."


Quote: "In the meantime, although Feynman railed against philosophy, an instructor’s cryptic comment about “stream of consciousness” started him thinking about what he could learn of his own mind through introspection."


Quote: "His thoughts, he saw, did not so much slow down as fray apart, snapping from place to place without the logical connectives of waking brain work."


Quote: "authority that seemed to emanate from the “shop men.” Feynman wanted to be a shop man but felt he was a faker among these experts, so easy with their tools and their working-class talk, their ties tucked in their belts to avoid catching in the chuck. When Feynman tried to machine metal it never came out quite right. His disks were not quite flat. His holes were too big. His wheels wobbled. Yet he understood these gadgets and he savored small triumphs."


Quote: "but every conclusion, however logical, that might lead to a disturbance of feeling is rejected from the outset."


Quote: "It is simply not thought. And thus everything that corresponds with objective valuations is good: these things are loved or treasured; the rest seems merely to exist in a world apart."


Quote: "Feeling loses its personal character -- it becomes feeling per se; it almost seems as though the [p. 450] personality were wholly dissolved in the feeling of the moment. Now, since in actual life situations constantly and successively alternate, in which the feeling-tones released are not only different but are actually mutually contrasting, the personality inevitably becomes dissipated in just so many different feelings."


Quote: "the original compensatory attitude of the unconscious becomes a manifest opposition. This reveals itself, in the first instance, in extravagant demonstrations of feeling, in loud and obtrusive feeling predicates, which leave one, however, somewhat incredulous. They ring hollow; they are not convincing."
Note: lol happened so plainly with annie at hornudden


Quote: "Only a very slight alteration in the situation is needed to provoke forthwith an entirely contrary estimation of the selfsame object. The result of such an experience is that the observer is unable to take either judgment at all seriously."


Quote: "We have already seen that the extraverted feeling type, as a rule, represses his thinking, just because thinking is the function most liable to disturb feeling."


Quote: "In its totality, the life of this type is never dependent upon reasoning judgment alone; it is influenced in almost equal degree by unconscious irrationality."
Note: jung says he iss infj


Quote: "I am also convinced that, had I myself chanced to possess a different individual psychology, I should have described the rational types in the reversed way, from the standpoint of the unconscious-as irrational, therefore."
Note: jung thought that the secondary function is unconscious


Quote: "application is concerned, is either inhibited or repressed. As an irrational function, sensation is equally repressed, whenever a rational function, thinking or feeling, possesses the priority, ie. it can be said to have a conscious function, only in so far as the rational attitude of consciousness permits accidental perceptions to become conscious contents; in short, realizes them."


Quote: "known feeling as a subjective fact, the nature of extraverted feeling will not immediately be understood, since it has freed itself as fully as possible from the subjective factor, and has, instead, become wholly subordinated to the influence of the object. Even where it seems to show a certain independence of the quality of the concrete object, it is none the less under the spell of. traditional or generally valid standards of some sort. I may feel constrained, for instance, to use the predicate 'beautiful' or 'good', not because I find the object 'beautiful' or 'good' from my own subjective feeling, but because it is fitting and politic so to do; and fitting it certainly is, inasmuch as a contrary opinion would disturb the general feeling situation. A feeling-judgment such as this is in no way a simulation or a lie -- it is merely an act of accommodation. A picture, for instance, may be termed beautiful, because a picture that is hung in a drawing-room and bearing a well-known signature is generally assumed to be beautiful, or because the predicate 'ugly' might offend the family of the fortunate possessor, or because there is a benevolent intention on the part of the visitor to create a pleasant feeling-atmosphere,"


Quote: ""


Quote: ""


Quote: "Since it is primarily controlled by subjective preconditions, and is only secondarily concerned with the object, this feeling appears much less upon the surface and is, as a rule, misunderstood."


Quote: "It is a feeling which apparently depreciates the object; hence it usually becomes noticeable in its negative manifestations. The existence of a positive feeling can be inferred only indirectly, as it were."


Quote: "From objects that can never fit in with its aim it seems to glide unheedingly away."


Quote: "It puts forward negative feeling-judgments or assumes an air of profound indifference, as a measure of self-defence."
Note: he doesnt mean feel as emotion, he means feel as a function like thinkin is, a fjnction tht comes to conclusions 


Quote: "Everything, therefore, that has been said of the introverted thinking refers equally to introverted feeling, only here everything is felt while there it was thought."


Quote: "But the fact that thoughts can generally be expressed more intelligibly than feelings demands a more than ordinary descriptive or artistic capacity before the real wealth of this feeling can be even approximately [p. 491] presented or communicated to the outer world."


Quote: "Since they submit the control of their lives to their subjectively orientated feeling, their true motives generally remain concealed."


Quote: "Their outward demeanour is harmonious and inconspicuous; they reveal a delightful repose, a sympathetic parallelism, which has no desire to affect others, either to impress, influence, or change them in any way."


Quote: "Implicit in Feynman’s attitude was a sense that the laws of nature were not to be discovered so much as constructed."


Quote: "With simultaneity gone, sequentiality was foundering, causality was under pressure, and scientists generally felt themselves free to consider temporal possibilities that would have seemed farfetched a generation before."

Quote: "pull the old tray out at the same time, and it slipped—BANG! All the stuff went on the floor. And then, naturally, the question was, “What were you doing? How did it fall?” Well, how could I explain that I was trying to invent a new way to handle trays?"
Note: had a similar thought


Quote: "remember thinking, “What a contrast—the person sitting at the table gets this nice cake on a doilied plate, while the pantry man back there with the stubby thumbs is saying, ‘Damn deez doilies!’” So that was the difference between the real world and what it looked like."


Quote: "I say, “Look at the way I have of cutting beans!”—and just at that moment I put a finger through instead of a bean. Blood came out and went on the beans, and there was a big excitement: “Look at how many beans you spoiled! What a stupid way to do things!” and so on. So I was never able to make any improvement, which would have been easy—with a guard, or something—but no, there was no chance for improvement."
Note: huh same probem i had


Quote: "I explained to them what I meant and how it worked in this case, and it solved the problem. It turned out it was Bernoulli’s equation that I meant, but I had read all this stuff in the encyclopedia without talking to anybody about it, so I didn’t know how to pronounce anything."

Note: my wonder is what is authenticity and what is fake and when should we be authentic. but maybe that is a dumb question 


Quote: "I wrote about liberty in social occasions—the problem of having to fake and lie in order to be polite, and does this perpetual game of faking in social situations lead to the “destruction of the moral fiber of society.”"


Quote: "But when we had to write a theme on Goethe’s Faust, it was hopeless! The work was too long to make a parody of it or to invent something else. I was storming back and forth in the fraternity saying, “I can’t do it. I’m just not gonna do it. I ain’t gonna do it!”"


Quote: "So I did that. I wrote a long theme, “On the Limitations of Reason.” I had thought about scientific techniques for solving problems, and how there are certain limitations: moral values cannot be decided by scientific methods, yak, yak, yak, and so on. Then another fraternity brother offered some"
Note: my wonder is what is authenticity and what is fake and when should we be authentic. but maybe that is a dumb question. but the anwer depends on you an i wold say experimentation is needed. 


Note: my wonder is what is authenticity and what is fake and when should we be authentic. but maybe that is a dumb question. but the anwer depends on you an i wold say experimentation is needed. i would theorize, an aready having experimented i have obserrved that, you control the atmosphere with your intent and words. so you dont have to lie but if you say anngry things or sad things then naturly peopl will feel angry or sad or whatever you put across

Quote: "At the end of the theme I pointed out that all of these observations were made while I was watching myself fall asleep, and I don’t really know what it’s like to fall asleep when I’m not watching myself. I concluded the theme with a little verse I made up, which pointed out this problem of introspection: I wonder why. I wonder why. I wonder why I wonder. I wonder why I wonder why I wonder why I wonder!"
Note: seems very naive. like really not thinking about his actions and beliefs. 


Quote: "We were really in hot water that time! In fact, we had lots of “hot water” experiments. The other fellas in the company decided we should run advertisements in Modern Plastics magazine. A few things we metal-plated were very pretty. They looked good in the advertisements. We also had a few things out in a showcase in front, for prospective customers to look at, but nobody could pick up the things in the advertisements or in the showcase to see how well the plating stayed on. Perhaps some of them were, in fact, pretty good jobs. But they were made specially; they were not regular products."
Note: cuz biology s so vast. 


Quote: "So right away I found out something about biology: it was very easy to find a question that was very interesting, and that nobody knew the answer to. In physics you had to go a little deeper before you could find an interesting question that people didn’t know."
Note: thats how i feel about biology


Quote: "“Oh,” I say, “you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you’ve had four years of biology.” They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes."
Note: omg same. i think this will probably happen but i want to be surprised

Quote: "Then the son told me what happened. The last time he was there, Bohr said to his son, “Remember the name of that little fellow in the back over there? He’s the only guy who’s not afraid of me, and will say when I’ve got a crazy idea. So next time when we want to discuss ideas, we’re not going to be able to do it with these guys who say everything is yes, yes, Dr. Bohr. Get that guy and we’ll talk with him first.”"

Quote: "“It happens very rarely, when I’ve been paying attention to a person with a foreign accent. As I’m falling asleep I can hear his voice very clearly. The first time it happened was while I was a student at MIT. I could hear old professor Vallarta say, ‘Dee-a dee-a electric field-a.’ And the other time was in Chicago during the war, when Professor Teller was explaining to me how the bomb worked. Since I’m interested in all kinds of phenomena, I wondered how I could hear these voices with accents so precisely, when I couldn’t imitate them that well…Doesn’t everybody have something like that happen once in a while?” The psychiatrist"


Quote: "If you’re teaching a class, you can think about the elementary things that you know very well. These things are kind of fun and delightful. It doesn’t do any harm to think them over again. Is there a better way to present them? Are there any new problems associated with them? Are there any new thoughts you can make about them? The elementary things are easy to think about; if you can’t think of a new thought, no harm done; what you thought about it before is good enough for the class. If you do think of something new, you’re rather pleased that you have a new way of looking at it."


Quote: "You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It’s their mistake, not my failing."
Note: lol so men bought girls with drinks back then and ere fine with it 


Quote: "But in that bar there are lots of intelligent guys—oil guys, mineral guys, important businessmen, and so forth—and all the time they’re buying the girls drinks, and they get nothin’ for it!” (By this time I had deduced that nobody else was getting anything out of all those drinks either.) “How is it possible,” I asked, “that an ‘intelligent’ guy can be such a goddamn fool when he gets into a bar?”"


Quote: "First look: “Oh-oh, competition coming up. He’s gonna take her away from me after I bought her a drink! What’s gonna happen?”"
Note: lol me in the game days.... god

Note: Lol. 


Quote: "“OK,” he says. “The whole principle is this: The guy wants to be a gentleman. He doesn’t want to be thought of as impolite, crude, or especially a cheapskate. As long as the girl knows the guy’s motives so well, it’s easy to steer him in the direction she wants him to go. “Therefore,” he continued, “under no circumstances be a gentleman! You must disrespect the girls. Furthermore, the very first rule is, don’t buy a girl anything—not even a package of cigarettes—until you’ve asked her if she’ll sleep with you, and you’re convinced that she will, and that she’s not lying.”"
Note: jesus 


Quote: "Well, someone only has to give me the principle, and I get the idea. All during the next day I built up my psychology differently: I adopted the attitude that those bar girls are all bitches, that they aren’t worth anything, and all they’re in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they’re not going to give you a goddamn thing; I’m not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches, and so on. I learned it till it was automatic."


Quote: "On the way to the bar I was working up nerve to try the master’s lesson on an ordinary girl. After all, you don’t feel so bad disrespecting a bar girl who’s trying to get you to buy her drinks—but a nice, ordinary, Southern girl? We went into the bar, and before I sat down, I said, “Listen, before I buy you a drink, I want to know one thing: Will you sleep with me tonight?” “Yes.” So it worked even with an ordinary girl! But no matter how effective the lesson was, I never really used it after that. I didn’t enjoy doing it that way. But it was interesting to know that things worked much differently from how I was brought up."
Note: i heard about that shit in brazik


Quote: "It was a kind of one-upmanship, where nobody knows what’s going on, and they’d put the other one down as if they did know."

Quote: "At first I was a little bit afraid: the girls were so beautiful, they had such a reputation, and so forth. I would try to meet them, and I’d choke a little bit when I talked. It was difficult at first, but gradually it got easier, and finally I had enough confidence that I wasn’t afraid of anybody. I had a way of having adventures which is hard to explain: it’s like fishing, where you put a line out and then you have to have patience. When I would tell someone about some of my adventures, they might say, “Oh, come on—let’s do that!” So we would go to a bar to see if something will happen, and they would lose patience after twenty minutes or so. You have to spend a couple of days before something happens, on average. I spent a lot of time talking to show girls. One would introduce me to another, and after a while, something interesting would often happen."

Note: thats stupid cursory solution to the prroblem of choice. i mean at least having an unbreakable rule. 


Quote: "I did that once when I was a student at MIT. I got sick and tired of having to decide what kind of dessert I was going to have at the restaurant, so I decided it would always be chocolate ice cream, and never worried about it again—I had the solution to that problem. Anyway, I decided it would always be Caltech."


Quote: "That was for me: I can’t understand anything in general unless I’m carrying along in my mind a specific example and watching it go. Some people think in the beginning that I’m kind of slow and I don’t understand the problem, because I ask a lot of these “dumb” questions: “Is a cathode plus or minus? Is an an-ion this way, or that way?”"


Quote: "He thinks I’m following the steps mathematically, but that’s not what I’m doing. I have the specific, physical example of what he’s trying to analyze, and I know from instinct and experience the properties of the thing.

Quote: "They were always telling me to “loosen up,” to become more relaxed about drawing. I figured that made no more sense than telling someone who’s just learning to drive to “loosen up” at the wheel. It isn’t going to work. Only after you know how to do it carefully can you begin to loosen up. So I resisted this perennial loosen-up stuff."
Note: omg feynman you tard


Quote: "When I finally got my pencil to work, I tried it again. I found that my drawing had a kind of strength—a funny, semi-Picasso-like strength—which appealed to me. The reason I felt good about that drawing was, I knew it was impossible to draw well that way, and therefore it didn’t have to be good—and that’s really what the loosening up was all about. I had thought that “loosen up” meant “make sloppy drawings,” but it really meant to relax and not worry about how the drawing is going to come out."
Note: huh it took me 20 years to figure that out but feynman much longer


Quote: "What I got out of that story was something still very new to me: I understood at last what art is really for, at least in certain respects. It gives somebody, individually, pleasure."


Quote: "Once when I was over at Jerry’s, I said to his wife Dabney, “I can never get the girls to pose nude: I don’t know how Jerry does it!” “Well, did you ever ask them?” “Oh! I never thought of that.” The next girl I met that I wanted to pose for me was a Caltech student. I asked her if she would pose nude. “Certainly,” she said, and there we were! So it was easy. I guess there was so much in the back of my mind that I thought it was somehow wrong to ask."
Note: ugh thess people


Quote: "sit and talk to them, they’d make no sense whatsoever! One guy in particular, the biggest faker, always dressed funny; he had a big black bowler hat. He would answer your questions in an incomprehensible way, and when you’d try to find out more about what he said by asking him about some of the words he used, off we’d be in another direction! The only thing he contributed, ultimately, to the exhibit for art and technology was a portrait of himself."

Quote: "One of the questions the rabbinical students and I discussed at some length was why it is that in academic things, such as theoretical physics, there is a higher proportion of Jewish kids than their proportion in the general population. The rabbinical students thought the reason was that the Jews have a history of respecting learning: They respect their rabbis, who are really teachers, and they respect education."


Quote: "I realized that there are not many people who think it’s just as important, and just as nice, to meet a professor as to meet a general. So I guess there’s something in what they said."

They said things like, “We’re very glad to hear you’re on the committee because we really wanted a scientific guy…” and “It’s wonderful to have a scientist on the committee, because our books are scientifically oriented…” But they also said things like, “We’d like to explain to you what our book is about…” and “We’ll be very glad to help you in any way we can to judge our books…” That seemed to me kind of crazy. I’m an objective scientist, and it seemed to me that since the only thing the kids in school are going to get is the books (and the teachers get the teacher’s manual, which I would also get), any extra explanation from the company was a distortion. So I didn’t want to speak to any of the publishers and always replied, “You don’t have to explain; I’m sure the books will speak for themselves.”"

Quote: "They were teaching something they didn’t understand, and which was, in fact, useless, at that time, for the child."


Quote: "That would be interesting for a kid who could understand base ten—something to entertain his mind. But what they had turned it into, in these books, was that every child had to learn another base! And then the usual horror would come: “Translate these numbers, which are written in base seven, to base five.” Translating from one base to another is an utterly useless thing. If you can do it, maybe it’s entertaining; if you can’t do it, forget it. There’s no point to it."


Quote: "Then I came to my first meeting. The other members had given some kind of ratings to some of the books, and they asked me what my ratings were. My rating was often different from theirs, and they would ask, “Why did you rate that book low?” I would say the trouble with that book was this and this on page so-and-so—I had my notes. They discovered that I was kind of a goldmine: I would tell them, in detail, what was good and bad in all the books; I had a reason for every rating."

Quote: "“It’s because somebody knows something about it that we can’t talk about physics. It’s the things that nobody knows anything about that we can discuss. We can talk about the weather; we can talk about social problems; we can talk about psychology; we can talk about international finance—gold transfers we can’t talk about, because those are understood—so it’s the subject that nobody knows anything about that we can all talk about!”"


Quote: "The people of Japan believed they had only one way of moving up: to have their children educated more than they were; that it was very important for them to move out of their peasantry to become educated. So there has been a great energy in the family to encourage the children to do well in school, and to be pushed forward. Because of this tendency to learn things all the time, new ideas from the outside would spread through the educational system very easily. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why Japan has advanced so rapidly.” All in all, I must say I enjoyed the visit to Sweden, in the"

Quote: "Yet these things are said to be scientific. We study them. And I think ordinary people with commonsense ideas are intimidated by this pseudoscience. A teacher who has some good idea of how to teach her children to read is forced by the school system to do it some other way—or is even fooled by the school system into thinking that her method is not necessarily a good one. Or a parent of bad boys, after disciplining them in one way or another, feels guilty for the rest of her life because she didn’t do “the right thing,” according to the experts."


Quote: "honesty—a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid—not only what you think is right about it:"


Quote: "Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can—if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong—to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it."


Quote: "There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition."


Quote: "In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another."


Quote: "So it’s the implication which has been conveyed, not the fact, which is true, and the difference is what we have to deal with."


Quote: "bending over backwards to show how you’re maybe wrong, that you ought to have when acting as a scientist."
Note: yes! pure honesty! 


Quote: "If you’re representing yourself as a scientist, then you should explain to the layman what you’re doing—and if they don’t want to support you under those circumstances, then that’s their decision."


Quote: "I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment of the other person—to do it under condition X to see if she could also get result A, and then change to Y and see if A changed."


Quote: "Nowadays there’s a certain danger of the same thing happening, even in the famous field of physics. I was shocked to hear of an experiment done at the big accelerator at the National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen with light hydrogen, he had to use data from someone else’s experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on different apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn’t get time on the program (because there’s so little time and it’s such expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on this apparatus because there wouldn’t be any new result. And so the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for public relations purposes, they are destroying—possibly—the value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of the thing."


Quote: "So I have just one wish for you—the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom."

Quote: "To do so would be impossible in any case, since a joyful life is an individual creation that cannot be copied from a recipe."


Quote: "Aristotle’s view of happiness"


Quote: "Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person."


Quote: "People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy."


Quote: "Viktor Frankl, the Austrian psychologist, summarized it beautifully in the preface to his book Man’s Search for Meaning: “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue…as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself.”"


Quote: "Yet we have all experienced times when, instead of being buffeted by anonymous forces, we do feel in control of our actions, masters of our own fate. On the rare occasions that it happens, we feel a sense of exhilaration, a deep sense of enjoyment that is long cherished and that becomes a landmark in memory for what life should be like. This is what we mean by optimal experience."


Quote: "The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile."


Quote: "Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen."


Quote: "But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life—that comes as close to what is usually meant by happiness as anything else we can conceivably imagine."
Note: theory from observations. not theories based on abstractions. 


Quote: "My first studies involved a few hundred “experts”—artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons—in other words, people who seemed to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred. From their accounts of what it felt like to do what they were doing, I developed a theory"


Quote: "This technique, called the Experience Sampling Method, involves asking people to wear an electronic paging device for a week and to write down how they feel and what they are thinking about whenever the pager signals."


Quote: "At present the most extensive collection of data outside of Chicago is at the Institute of Psychology of the Medical School, the University of Milan, Italy."


Quote: "In the quest for happiness, partial solutions don’t work."


Quote: "However well-intentioned, books cannot give recipes for how to be happy."


Quote: "Because optimal experience depends on the ability to control what happens in consciousness moment by moment, each person has to achieve it on the basis of his own individual efforts and creativity."


Quote: "What a book can do, however, and what this one will try to accomplish, is to present examples of how life can be made more enjoyable, ordered in the framework of a theory, for readers to reflect upon and from which they may then draw their own conclusions."


Quote: "The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy—or attention—is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action."


Quote: "By stretching skills, by reaching toward higher challenges, such a person becomes an increasingly extraordinary individual."


Quote: "Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life. And whenever some of our needs are temporarily met, we immediately start wishing for more. This chronic dissatisfaction is the second obstacle that stands in the way of contentment. To deal with these obstacles, every culture develops with time protective devices—religions, philosophies, arts, and comforts—that help shield us from chaos. They help us believe that we are in control of what is happening and give reasons for being satisfied with our lot. But these shields are effective only for a while; after a few centuries, sometimes after only a few decades, a religion or belief wears out and no longer provides the spiritual sustenance it once did."


Quote: "When people try to achieve happiness on their own, without the support of a faith, they usually seek to maximize pleasures that are either biologically programmed in their genes or are out as attractive by the society in which they live. Wealth, power, and sex become the chief goals that give direction to their strivings. But the quality of life cannot be improved this way. Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive moment-by-moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the obstacles to fulfillment."


Quote: "Even planet Earth, which can be so idyllic and picturesque, is not to be taken for granted. To survive on it men and women have had to struggle for millions of years against ice, fire, floods, wild animals, and invisible microorganisms that appear out of nowhere to snuff us out."


Quote: "The foremost reason that happiness is so hard to achieve is that the universe was not designed with the comfort of human beings in mind. It is almost immeasurably huge, and most of it is hostilely empty and cold."


Quote: "It seems that every time a pressing danger is avoided, a new and more sophisticated threat appears on the horizon. No sooner do we invent a new substance than its by-products start poisoning the environment. Throughout history, weapons that were designed to provide security have turned around and threatened to destroy their makers."


Quote: "It is important to do as much as we can to prevent nuclear war, to abolish social injustice, to eradicate hunger and disease. But it is prudent not to expect that efforts to change external conditions will immediately improve the quality of our lives. As J. S. Mill wrote, “No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.”"


Quote: "How we feel about ourselves, the joy we get from living, ultimately depend directly on how the mind filters and interprets everyday experiences."
Note: maybe those random moments where i lose touch of everuything have something to do eith this 


Quote: "One of the major functions of every culture has been to shield its members from chaos, to reassure them of their importance and ultimate success. The Eskimo, the hunter of the Amazon basin, the Chinese, the Navajo, the Australian Aborigine, the New Yorker—all have taken for granted that they live at the center of the universe, and that they have a special dispensation that puts them on the fast track to the future. Without such trust in exclusive privileges, it would be difficult to face the odds of existence. This is as it"


Quote: "When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned."
Note: THATS THE FEELING!!!!! 


Quote: "The lack of inner order manifests itself in the subjective condition that some call ontological anxiety, or existential dread. Basically, it is a fear of being, a feeling that there is no meaning to life and that existence is not worth going on with."


Quote: "The lack of inner order manifests itself in the subjective condition that some call ontological anxiety, or existential dread. Basically, it is a fear of being, a feeling that there is no meaning to life and that existence is not worth going on with. Nothing seems to make sense."


Quote: "If we are learning to be more assertive, we might inadvertently alienate our friends."


Quote: "Traditionally, the problem of existence has been most directly confronted through religion, and an increasing number of the disillusioned are turning back to it, choosing either one of the standard creeds or a more esoteric Eastern variety. But religions are only temporarily successful attempts"


Quote: "If values and institutions no longer provide as supportive a framework as they once did, each person must use whatever tools are available to carve out a meaningful, enjoyable life. One of the most important tools in this quest is provided by psychology."
Note: so this attitude is not a recent phenomenon. 


Quote: "“We are always getting to live,” as Ralph Waldo Emerson used to say, “but never living.” Or as poor Frances learned in the children’s story, it is always bread and jam tomorrow, never bread and jam today."


Quote: "As Freud and many others before and after him have noted, civilization is built on the repression of individual desires. It would be impossible to maintain any kind of social order, any complex division of labor, unless society’s members were forced to take on the habits and skills that the culture required, whether the individuals liked it or not."


Quote: "Socialization, or the transformation of a human organism into a person who functions successfully within a particular social system, cannot be avoided. The essence of socialization is to make people dependent on social controls, to have them respond predictably to rewards and punishments. And the most effective form of socialization is achieved when people identify so thoroughly with the social order that they no longer can imagine themselves breaking any of its rules."


Quote: "The person who cannot resist food or alcohol, or whose mind is constantly focused on sex, is not free to direct his or her psychic energy."


Quote: "The most important step in emancipating oneself from social controls is the ability to find rewards in the events of each moment. If a person learns to enjoy and find meaning in the ongoing stream of experience, in the process of living itself, the burden of social controls automatically falls from one’s shoulders."


Quote: "Since what we experience is reality, as far as we are concerned, we can transform reality to the extent that we influence what happens in consciousness and thus free ourselves from the threats and blandishments of the outside world."


Quote: "“Men are not afraid of things, but of how they view them,” said Epictetus a long time ago. And the great emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote: “If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgment of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.”"

Quote: "The Christian monastic orders perfected various methods for learning how to channel thoughts and desires. Ignatius of Loyola rationalized them in his famous spiritual exercises."


Quote: "Freud pointed out, the two tyrants that fought for control over the mind were the id and the superego, the first a servant of the genes, the second a lackey of society—both representing the “Other.” Opposed to them was the ego, which stood for the genuine needs of the self connected to its concrete environment."


Quote: "Although quite different from one another in many respects, the yogi disciplines in India, the Taoist approach to life developed in China, and the Zen varieties of Buddhism all seek to free consciousness from the deterministic influences of outside forces—be they biological or social in nature."


Quote: "Freud was still alive when his quest for liberating the ego from its oppressors was turned into a staid ideology and a rigidly regulated profession. Marx was even less fortunate: his attempts to free consciousness from the tyranny of economic exploitation were soon turned into a system of repression that would have boggled the poor founder’s mind."


Quote: "Dostoevsky among many others observed, if Christ had returned to preach his message of liberation in the Middle Ages, he would have been crucified again and again by the leaders of that very church whose worldly power was built on his name."

Quote: "inhuman conditions of factory labor became the most obvious obstacles to the workers’ freedom to order their own experience, as they were in nineteenth-century industrial Europe, Marx’s message turned out to be especially relevant."


Quote: "the ability to control oneself is not held in high esteem. People who attempt it are thought to be faintly ridiculous, “uptight,” or not quite “with it.” But whatever the dictates of fashion, it seems that those who take the trouble to gain mastery over what happens in consciousness do live a happier life."

Quote: "The remarkable accomplishments of Hindu fakirs"


Quote: "With this framework in mind, what, then, does it mean to be conscious? It simply means that certain specific conscious events (sensations, feelings, thoughts, intentions) are occurring, and that we are able to direct their course."
Note: but that doesnt include unconscious processing


Quote: "It seems we can manage at most seven bits of information—such as differentiated sounds, or visual stimuli, or recognizable nuances of emotion or thought—at any one time, and that the shortest time it takes to discriminate between one set of bits and another is about 1/18 of a second. By using these figures one concludes that it is possible to process at most 126 bits of information per second,"


Quote: "Because attention determines what will or will not appear in consciousness, and because it is also required to make any other mental events—such as remembering, thinking, feeling, and making decisions—happen there, it is useful to think of it as psychic energy."


Quote: "At this point, almost all the components needed to understand how consciousness can be controlled are in place. We have seen that experience depends on the way we invest psychic energy—on the structure of attention. This, in turn, is related to goals and intentions. These processes are connected to each other by the self, or the dynamic mental representation we have of the entire system of our goals. These are the pieces that must be maneuvered if we wish to improve things."
Note: development is an increase in complexity according to mahaly


Quote: "Following a flow experience, the organization of the self is more complex than it had been before. It is by becoming increasingly complex that the self might be said to grow."


Quote: "Complexity is the result of two broad psychological processes: differentiation and integration. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, toward separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas and entities beyond the self. A complex self is one that succeeds in combining these opposite tendencies."


Quote: "Enjoyment is characterized by this forward movement: by a sense of novelty, of accomplishment."


Quote: "For instance, everybody takes pleasure in eating. To enjoy food, however, is more difficult."


Quote: "we can experience pleasure without any investment of psychic energy, whereas enjoyment happens only as a result of unusual investments of attention."


Quote: "First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours. The combination of all these elements causes a sense of deep enjoyment that is so rewarding people feel that expending a great deal of energy is worthwhile simply to be able to feel it."


Quote: "Sometimes a person reports having an experience of extreme joy, a feeling of ecstasy for no apparent good reason: a bar of haunting music may trigger it, or a wonderful view, or even less—just a spontaneous sense of well-being."
Note: totally wht happened in stockholm and paris 


Quote: "For example, here is a quote from one of our studies, of a statement made by an art expert describing the enjoyment he takes in looking at a painting, something most people would regard as an immediate, intuitive process: “A lot of pieces that you deal with are very straightforward…and you don’t find anything exciting about them, you know, but there are other pieces that have some sort of challenge…. those are the pieces that stay in your mind, that are the most interesting.” In other words, even the passive enjoyment one gets from looking at a painting or sculpture depends on the challenges that the work of art contains."


Quote: "Everybody develops routines to fill in the boring gaps of the day, or to bring experience back on an even keel when anxiety threatens. Some people are compulsive doodlers, others chew on things or smoke, smooth their hair, hum a tune, or engage in more esoteric private rituals that have the same purpose: to impose order in consciousness through the performance of patterned action. These are the “microflow” activities that help us negotiate the doldrums of the day."


Quote: "In all the activities people in our study reported engaging in, enjoyment comes at a very specific point: whenever the opportunities for action perceived by the individual are equal to his or her capabilities."


Quote: "unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, she will not enjoy them. In some creative activities, where goals are not clearly set in advance, a person must develop a strong personal sense of what she intends to do."


Quote: "But each of us is temperamentally sensitive to a certain range of information that we learn to value more than most other people do, and it is likely that we will consider feedback involving that information to be more relevant than others might."


Quote: "One of the most frequently mentioned dimensions of the flow experience is that, while it lasts, one is able to forget all the unpleasant aspects of life."


Quote: "the flow experience is typically described as involving a sense of control—or, more precisely, as lacking the sense of worry about losing control that is typical in many situations of normal life. Here is how"


Quote: "As this example illustrates, what people enjoy is not the sense of being in control, but the sense of exercising control in difficult situations."


Quote: "The loss of the sense of a self separate from the world around it is sometimes accompanied by a feeling of union with the environment,"


Quote: "What slips below the threshold of awareness is the concept of self, the information we use to represent to ourselves who we are. And being able to forget temporarily who we are seems to be very enjoyable."


Quote: "When a person invests all her psychic energy into an interaction—whether it is with another person, a boat, a mountain, or a piece of music—she in effect becomes part of a system of action greater than what the individual self had been before. This system takes its form from the rules of the activity; its energy comes from the person’s attention."


Quote: "Often hours seem to pass by in minutes; in general, most people report that time seems to pass much faster. But occasionally the reverse occurs:"


Quote: "The key element of an optimal experience is that it is an end in itself."


Quote: "The flow experience, like everything else, is not “good” in an absolute sense. It is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strength and complexity of the self."


Quote: "WE HAVE SEEN HOW PEOPLE DESCRIBE the common characteristics of optimal experience: a sense that one’s skills are adequate to cope with the challenges at hand, in a goal-directed, rule-bound action system that provides clear clues as to how well one is performing."


Quote: "Concentration is so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems. Self-consciousness disappears, and the sense of time becomes distorted. An activity that produces such experiences is so gratifying that people are willing to do it for its own sake, with little concern for what they will get out of it, even when it is difficult, or dangerous."
Note: really? i hope this is true. 


Quote: "While such events may happen spontaneously, it is much more likely that flow will result either from a structured activity, or from an individual’s ability to make flow occur, or both."
Note: 4 types of games


Quote: "Agon includes games that have competition as their main feature, such as most sports and athletic events; alea is the class that includes all games of chance, from dice to bingo; ilinx, or vertigo, is the name he gives to activities that alter consciousness by scrambling ordinary perception, such as riding a merry-go-round or skydiving; and mimicry is the group of activities in which alternative realities are created, such as dance, theater, and the arts in general."


Quote: "We have come to accept that our morality simply no longer has currency outside our own culture. According to this new dogma, it is inadmissible to apply one set of values to evaluate another. And since every evaluation across cultures must necessarily involve at least one set of values foreign to one of the cultures being evaluated, the very possibility of comparison is ruled out."
Note: so bullshit


Quote: "society. A starting point would be to say that one society is “better” than another if a greater number of its people have access to experiences that are in line with their goals."


Quote: "Many ethnographic accounts suggest that built-in psychic entropy is more common in preliterate cultures than the myth of the “noble savage” would suggest."


Quote: "There is no evidence that any of these cultures chose to be selfish, violent, or fearful. Their behavior does not make them happier; on the contrary, it causes suffering. Such practices and beliefs, which interfere with happiness, are neither inevitable nor necessary; they evolved by chance, as a result of random responses to accidental conditions. But once they become part of the norms and habits of a culture, people assume that this is how things must be; they come to believe they have no other options."


Quote: "Cultures are defensive constructions against chaos, designed to reduce the impact of randomness on experience. They are adaptive responses, just as feathers are for birds and fur is for mammals. Cultures prescribe norms, evolve goals, build beliefs that help us tackle the challenges of existence. In so doing they must rule out many alternative goals and beliefs, and thereby limit possibilities; but this channeling of attention to a limited set of goals and means is what allows effortless action within self-created boundaries."
Note: yes! thaats why ive been feeling losst 


Quote: "It is in this respect that games provide a compelling analogy to cultures. Both consist of more or less arbitrary goals and rules that allow people to become involved in a process and act with a minimum of doubts and distractions."


Quote: "Cultures are all-embracing: they specify how a person should be born, how she should grow up, marry, have children, and die. Games fill out the interludes of the cultural script. They enhance action and concentration during “free time,” when cultural instructions offer little guidance, and a person’s attention threatens to wander into the uncharted realms of chaos."


Quote: "It is not easy to transform ordinary experience into flow, but almost everyone can improve his or her ability to do so."


Quote: "When a person cannot control psychic energy, neither learning nor true enjoyment is possible."
Note: state in game 


Quote: "A less drastic obstacle to experiencing flow is excessive self-consciousness. A person who is constantly worried about how others will perceive her, who is afraid of creating the wrong impression, or of doing something inappropriate, is also condemned to permanent exclusion from enjoyment."


Quote: "So are people who are excessively self-centered. A self-centered individual is usually not self-conscious, but instead evaluates every bit of information only in terms of how it relates to her desires. For such a person everything is valueless in itself."


Quote: "When the now extinct natives of the Caribbean islands were put to work in the plantations of the conquering Spaniards, their lives became so painful and meaningless that they lost interest in survival, and eventually ceased reproducing."
Note: look up this guy! 


Quote: "Two terms describing states of social pathology apply also to conditions that make flow difficult to experience: anomie and alienation. Anomie—literally, “lack of rules”—is the name the French sociologist Emile Durkheim gave to a condition in society in which the norms of behavior had become muddled. When it is no longer clear what is permitted and what is not, when it is uncertain what public opinion values, behavior becomes erratic and meaningless."
Note: this guy! 


Quote: "Alienation is in many ways the opposite: it is a condition in which people are constrained by the social system to act in ways that go against their goals."


Quote: "The more one studies attempted solutions to problems in politics and economics, in art, philosophy, and religion, the more one has the impression of extremely gifted people wearing out their ingenuity at the impossible and futile task of trying to get the water of life into neat and permanent packages."


Quote: "In the past hundred years so many long-established traditions have broken down—traditions of family and social life, of government, of the economic order, and of religious belief."


Quote: "Human beings appear to be happy just so long as they have a future to which they can look forward—whether it be a “good time” tomorrow or an everlasting life beyond the grave."

Quote: "The modern scientist is not so naive as to deny God because he cannot be found with a telescope, or the soul because it is not revealed by the scalpel. He has merely noted that the idea of God is logically unnecessary. He even doubts that it has any meaning."
Note: thats what religion seems to me. saying nothing.


Quote: "He argues that if everything which happens is said to be under the providence and control of God, this actually amounts to saying nothing."


Quote: "It may be necessary for man to have a myth, but he cannot self-consciously prescribe one as he can mix a pill for a headache."


Quote: "When belief in the eternal becomes impossible, and there is only the poor substitute of belief in believing, men seek their happiness in the joys of time."

Quote: "“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.”"


Quote: "If, then, we are to be fully human and fully alive and aware, it seems that we must be willing to suffer for our pleasures. Without such willingness there can be no growth in the intensity of consciousness."
Note: why drugs are popular


Quote: "Under these circumstances, the life that we live is a contradiction and a conflict. Because consciousness must involve both pleasure and pain, to strive for pleasure to the exclusion of pain is, in effect, to strive for the loss of consciousness."
Note: why travelling has been difficult


Quote: "For the animal to be happy it is enough that this moment be enjoyable. But man is hardly satisfied with this at all. He is much more concerned to have enjoyable memories and expectations — especially the latter. With these assured, he can put up with an extremely miserable present. Without this assurance, he can be extremely miserable in the midst of immediate physical pleasure."
Note: meditation might help to achieve flow more easily


Quote: "While paying attention ordinarily involves an additional burden of information processing above the usual baseline effort, for people who have learned to control consciousness focusing attention is relatively effortless, because they can shut off all mental processes but the relevant ones. It is this flexibility of attention, which contrasts so sharply with the helpless overinclusion of the schizophrenic, that may provide the neurological basis for the autotelic personality."


Quote: "The family context promoting optimal experience could be described as having five characteristics."

Quote: "Narcissistic individuals, who are mainly concerned with protecting their self, fall apart when the external conditions turn threatening."


Quote: "Without interest in the world, a desire to be actively related to it, a person becomes isolated into himself. Bertrand Russell, one of the greatest philosophers of our century, described how he achieved personal happiness: “Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection.”"

These may amount simply to learning more and more about the friend, discovering new facets of his or her unique individuality, and disclosing more of one’s own individuality in the process."


Quote: "If a person surrounds himself with “friends” who simply reaffirm his public persona, who never question his dreams and desires, who never force him to try out new ways of being, he misses out on the opportunities friendship presents."


Quote: "It is someone who shares our goal of self-realization, and therefore is willing to share the risks that any increase in complexity entails."


Quote: "A true friend is someone we can occasionally be crazy with, someone who does not expect us to be always true to form."


Quote: "But later in life friendships rarely happen by chance: one must cultivate them as assiduously as one must cultivate a job or a family."


Quote: "Social science surveys have universally concluded that people claim to be most happy with friends and family, or just in the company of others. When they are asked to list pleasant activities that improve their mood for the entire day, the kind of events most often mentioned are “Being with happy people,” “Having people show interest in what I say,” “Being with friends,” and “Being noticed as sexually attractive.”"
Note: so being noticed as sexually attractive really brightens peoples day


Note: so being noticed as sexually attractive really brightens peoples day but of course it has to be delivered in an authentic sincere way 


Note: definitely what i have tried to do 


Quote: "We think that making sense out of life is impossible unless the flow of events can somehow be fitted into a framework of rigid forms. To be meaningful, life must be understandable in terms of fixed ideas and laws, and these in turn must correspond to unchanging and eternal realities behind the shifting scene."
Note: definitely what i have tried to do. but my truths are always changing, and a positive benefit (i think?) is that they provide direction in my life


Quote: "The root of the difficulty is that we have developed the power of thinking so rapidly and one-sidedly that we have forgotten the proper relation between thoughts and events, words and things. Conscious thinking has gone ahead and created its own world, and, when this is found to conflict with the real world, we have the sense of a profound discord between “I,” the conscious thinker, and nature."
Note: man can know the rigt choice


Note: thi ishy i started to o crazy after 4acodmt. defining things asking questions whose nswers brought more questions that led in a cirle pinning in an infitinite while loop that ha no exit unles istopped asking the poontless quustion regardig lifes prpse, what i should be doing.


Quote: "More and more we try to effect an adaptation to life by means of external gadgets, and attempt to solve our problems by conscious thinking rather than unconscious “know-how.” This is much less to our advantage than we like to suppose."


Quote: "Since what we know of the future is made up of purely abstract and logical elements—inferences, guesses, deductions—it cannot be eaten, felt, smelled, seen, heard, or otherwise enjoyed. To pursue it is to pursue a constantly retreating phantom, and the faster you chase it, the faster it runs ahead,"


Quote: "Thus the “brainy” economy designed to produce this happiness is a fantastic vicious circle which must either manufacture more and more pleasures or collapse—providing a constant titillation of the ears, eyes, and nerve ends with incessant streams of almost inescapable noise and visual distractions."
Note: so similar to walden


Quote: "The individual living-units in these warrens are designed less for living as for creating an impression. The main space is devoted to a “living room” of proportions suitable to a large house, while such essential spaces for living (rather than mere “entertaining”) as the kitchen are reduced to small closets where one can hardly move—much less cook. Consequently these wretched little galleys provide fare which is chiefly gaseous—cocktails and “appetizers” rather than honest meals. Because we all want to be “ladies and gentlemen” and look as if we had servants, we do not soil our hands with growing and cooking real food. Instead we buy products designed for “front” and appearance rather than content—immense and tasteless fruit, bread which is little more than a light froth, wine faked with chemicals, and vegetables flavored with the arid concoctions of test tubes which render them so much impressive pulp."
Note: yes. happened many times. always searching for sex which my mind thinks i want but my body does not and it causes lots off anxiety. 


Quote: "But of all pleasures sex is the one which the civilized man pursues with the greatest anxiey. That the craving is brainy rather than bodily is shown by the common impotence of the male when he comes to the act, his brain pursuing what his genes do not at the moment desire. This confuses him hopelessly, because he simply cannot understand not wanting the great delicacy of sex when it is available. He has been hankering after it for hours and days on end, but when the reality appears his body will not co-operate."

Quote: "We rightly mistrust the “snap” answers of strained and wandering minds, but the rapid, effortless, and almost unconscious solution of logical problems is what the brain is supposed to deliver."


Quote: ""
Note: flow. thats why its in our best interest to pursue the activities which interest us and out us in flow. 


Quote: "The brain can only assume its proper behavior when consciousness is doing what it is designed for: not writhing and whirling to get out of present experience, but being effortlessly aware of it."


Quote: "How are we to find security and peace of mind in a world whose very nature is insecurity, impermanence, and unceasing change? All these questions demand a method and a course of action. At the same time, all of them show that the problem has not been understood. We do not need action—yet. We need more light."
Note: true. all the times i cut myself off from the flow of life i feel shitty ann disonnecfted. like when i stopped myself from clappin after seeing the connection at the outdoor screening in zagreb 


Quote: "To put it still more plainly: the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing."
Note: true. all the times i cut myself off from the flow of life i feel shitty ann disonnecfted. like when i stopped myself from clappin after seeing the connection at the outdoor screening in zagreb i desired security anxd so i stopped the flow and then felt bad 


Note: saying yu shojld not feel a certin way when you are feeling that way is harmful


Note: yeah! we dont actually want to go down the safe route. 


Quote: "In other words, if we can really understand what we are looking for—that safety is isolation, and what we do to ourselves when we look for it—we shall see that we do not want it at all."
Note: yeah! we dont actually want to go down the safe route, which isnt even guaranteed tol be safe, an which causes pain ann sufferin g anway so it isnt safe. 


Note: like?


Quote: "The human organism has the most wonderful powers of adaptation to both physical and psychological pain."
Note: if true its a good reason to practice awareness in times of pain. 


Quote: "But these can only come into full play when the pain is not being constantly restimulated by this inner effort to get away from it, to separate the “I” from the feeling. The effort creates a state of tension in which the pain thrives. But when the tension ceases, mind and body begin to absorb the pain as water reacts to a blow or cut."


Quote: "There are, then, two ways of understanding an experience. The first is to compare it with the memories of other experiences, and so to name and define it. This is to interpret it in accordance with the dead and the past. The second is to be aware of it as it is, as when, in the intensity of joy, we forget past and future, let the present be all, and thus do not even stop to think, “I am happy.”"
Note: so watts thinks this post event analysis is worthwhile afterall then. 


Quote: "Both ways of understanding have their uses."


Quote: "The point, then, is that when we try to understand the present by comparing it with memories, we do not understand it as deeply as when we are aware of it without comparison."
Note: so the solution is to be present lol how novel


Quote: "Thus to try to get out of, say, fear we endeavor at once to be separate from it and to “fix” it by interpreting it in terms of memory, in terms of what is already fixed and known. In other words, we try to adapt ourselves to the mysterious present by comparing it with the (remembered) past, by naming and “identifying” it."
Note: thats my question! what can you change?? 


Quote: "This would be all very well if you were trying to get away from something from which you can get away."
Note: wait what?? but iff yuy name threm then you can prescrive yourself a course of action that might lleviate the problem 


Quote: "To try to control fear or depression or boredom by calling them names is to resort to superstition of trust in curses and invocations."
Note: nooo because fear doesnt feel good and also dooesnt get us what we want 


Quote: "But why are we trying to be separate from fear? Because we are afraid."
Note: that a good reason 


Quote: "The more we accustom ourselves to understanding the present in terms of memory, the unknown by the known, the living by the dead, the more desiccated and embalmed, the more joyless and frustrated life becomes."
Note: duh but what does it mean in practice?


Quote: "The art of living in this “predicament” is neither careless drifting on the one hand nor fearful clinging to the past and the known on the other. It consists in being completely sensitive to each moment, in regarding it as utterly new and unique, in having the mind open and wholly receptive."
Note: this resonantes with my timee in europe, 


Quote: "Significantly enough, nervous and frustrated people are always busy, even in being idle, such idleness being the “laziness” of fear, not of rest."
Note: once uou define the presrnt it is already past an you are just doing anaalysis on mentl constructions. 


Quote: "This, in turn, depends upon seeing that you have really no choice but to be aware—because you cannot separate yourself from the present and you cannot define it. You can, indeed, refuse to admit this, but only at the cost of the immense and futile effort of spending your whole life resisting the inevitable."
Note: good


Note: exactly thr problem wiyh education now


Quote: "We are too exclusively bookish in our scholastic routine.… In the Garden of Eden Adam saw the animals before he named them: in the traditional system, children named the animals before they saw them.1"
Note: talking is so often about detailing the past orr fture or anaalyzing it, and al that tires me. i want coommunication that occurs in the present about the present. 


Quote: "On the contrary, it is only through silence that one can discover something new to talk about. One who talked incessantly, without stopping to look and listen, would repeat himself ad nauseam."
Note: but thenn how do w omee up with a nw dea? my guess wold be that all off the magic in the worlld occurs sspontaneousll an as a result of the intuition. 


Quote: "It is the same with thinking, which is really silent talking. It is not, by itself, open to the discovery of anything new, for its only novelties are simply rearrangements of old words and ideas."
Note: watts agrees


Quote: "Certainly the revolutionary thinker must go beyond thought. He knows that almost all his best ideas come to him when thinking has stopped."
Note: this is exacty what i was sayig in my apple notes when i wrote that if somethng ia dvine or god then it must be accessible to all peple at any moment in time. whatever is fundamental must not need to be found out about by discovering a crrtain book or person. 


Quote: "It is surely absurd to seek God in terms of a preconceived idea of what God is."

Note: thats spirituality for me. 


Quote: "Plucking chrysanthemums along the East fence; Gazing in silence at the southern hills; The birds flying home in pairs Through the soft mountain air of dusk— In these things there is a deep meaning, But when we are about to express it, We suddenly forget the words."


Quote: "Speculative philosophy, as we know it in the West, is almost entirely a symptom of the divided mind, of man trying to stand outside himself and his experience in order to verbalize and define it."
Note: ugh i do too much of this. 


Note: what does it men to live each moment completely for me? 


Quote: "But the undivided mind is free from this tension of trying always to stand outside oneself and to be elsewhere than here and now. Each moment is lived completely, and there is thus a sense of fulfillment and completeness."
Note: why satisficing is good. im sick and cuz i habe no energy to search long im satisficing and it feels great 


Quote: "The divided mind comes to the dinner table and pecks at one dish after another, rushing on without digesting anything to find one better than the last. It finds nothing good, because there is nothing which it really tastes."
Note: lol true 


Quote: "How often has the spring returned to the earth? Does it come faster and fancier every year, to be sure to be better than last spring, and to hurry on its way to the spring that shall out-spring all springs?"

Quote: "“As long as you do not know how to die and come to life again, you are but a sorry traveler on this dark earth.”"


Quote: "If morality is the art of living together, it is clear that rules, or rather techniques, have a place in it."
Note: this is the outrr game or social dkills part of life. 


Quote: "Like medicine, shoe-making, cookery, tailoring, farming, and carpentry, living together requires a certain “know-how.” It demands the acquisition and use of certain skills."
Note: not true 


Quote: "For the community is its own moralist. It elects and pays judges, policemen, and preachers, as if to say, “When I am difficult, please kick me.”"


Quote: "If it is true that man is necessarily motivated by the pleasure-pain principle, there is no point whatsoever in discussing human conduct. Motivated conduct is determined conduct; it will be what it will be, no matter what anyone has to say about it. There can be no creative morality unless man has the possibility of freedom."
Note: 2016: this is why ehen approaching you want to aproach jn a way ghat eccites you bwhile not expecting anything else in return 


Quote: "For all pleasures are present, and nothing save complete awareness of the present can even begin to guarantee future happiness."
Note: ya! evrryone running around flying places buying shit in a big hurry but yhrn ee dont even enjoy it when we have it 


Quote: "I can act in order to eat tomorrow, or take a trip to the mountains next week, but there is really no way of being certain that this will make me happy."
Note: ya thats what i realized but still unconscious is a useful concept althought its imaginary 


Quote: "This is but another example of split-mindedness, for what is the difference between “me” and “mental mechanisms” whether conscious or unconscious?"
Note: congruence, if you feel afraid, act but do not pretend you do not feel fear. 


Quote: "If I am afraid, my efforts to feel and act bravely are moved by the fear, for I am afraid of fear, which is simply to say that my efforts to escape from what I am are moving in a circle."
Note: oh no!! i do this sometie like at ozora when i gave that girl 2 euros and i didnt feel good at all after. doing charity to fill a hole in yourself will not provide good results. 


Quote: "Beside the examples of saints and heroes I feel ashamed that I amount to nothing, and so I begin to practice humility because of my wounded pride, and charity because of my self-love."


Quote: "So long as there is the motive to become something, so long as the mind believes in the possibility of escape from what it is at this moment, there can be no freedom."


Quote: "Nothing is really more inhuman than human relations based on morals. When a man gives bread in order to be charitable, lives with a woman in order to be faithful, eats with a Negro in order to be unprejudiced, and refuses to kill in order to be peaceful, he is as cold as a clam. He does not actually see the other person. Only a little less chilly is the benevolence springing from pity, which acts to remove suffering because it finds the sight of it disgusting."
Note: i cant force myselc to be love


Quote: "Everyone has love, but it can only come out when he is convinced of the impossibility and the frustration of trying to love himself."
Note: all thoguth is circular as it is constructed of references to other thoughts and memories of sense data


Note: my dumb ass thought loops 


Quote: "By contrast, hell or “everlasting damnation” is not the everlastingness of time going on forever, but of the unbroken circle, the continuity and frustration of going round and round in pursuit of something which can never be attained."


Quote: "If there is any problem at all, it is to see that in this instant you have no “I” to surrender. You are completely free to do this at any moment, and nothing whatever is stopping you."


Quote: "If, still thinking that there is an isolated “I,” you identify it with God, you become the insufferable ego-maniac who thinks himself successful in attaining the impossible, in dominating experience, and in pursuing all vicious circles to satisfactory conclusions."


Quote: "It is obvious that the only interesting people are interested people, and to be completely interested is to have forgotten about “I.”"
Note: this is why ive got to mpove on from my psychological and philosophical self analysis. i tried it during this past year in europe and i cant do it. i wont ever understand this thing, this life, or my mind throuvh concepts and words. time to just start doing instead of thinking. 


Quote: "free from trying to understand itself thought can think."
Note: what happened with the flow stick at ozora. 


Quote: "“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.”"
Note: good practice.


Quote: "We can begin anything we do—start our day, eat a meal, or walk into a meeting—with the intention to be open, flexible, and kind. Then we can proceed with an inquisitive attitude. As my teacher Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche used to say, “Live your life as an experiment.” At the end of the activity, whether we feel we have succeeded or failed in our intention, we seal the act by thinking of others, of those who are succeeding and failing all over the world. We wish that anything we learned in our experiment could also benefit them."
Note: its like how at ozora i started being able to see people as they are without  my preconceptions of them. 


Quote: "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. —ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPÉRY"
Note: its like how at ozora i started being able to see people as they are without  my preconceptions of them, after a series of heart opening approaches culminating with meeti g jesus 


Quote: "This sense of deep connection, of belonging to the same family, is bodhichitta."
Note: whhat happened at ozora. 


Note: ah ok


Quote: "Bodhichitta exists on two levels. First there is unconditional bodhichitta, an immediate experience that is refreshingly free of concept, opinion, and our usual all-caught-upness. It’s something hugely good that we are not able to pin down even slightly, like knowing at gut level that there’s absolutely nothing to lose. Second there is relative bodhichitta, our ability to keep our hearts and minds open to suffering without shutting down."


Quote: "Being caught by the lord of speech may start with just a reasonable conviction about what we feel to be true. However, if we find ourselves becoming righteously indignant, that’s a sure sign that we’ve gone too far and that our ability to effect change will be hindered."
Note: we all watch thoughts and emotions arise in us, we cant create them but for practical purposes we can focus our attention, like a spotlight we can direct it. philosophicaly maybe we have  o freee will r maybe we do i dunn but practically we have this control over our attention. 


Quote: "I am definitely not in control of what thoughts or emotions are going to arise, nor can I halt their flow."


Quote: "I feel gratitude that someone saw the truth and pointed out that we don’t suffer this kind of pain because of our personal inability to get things right."
Note: its observing the self and others and noting that historically no one has been able to avoid suffering so therefore we can say its a necessary part of life. 


Quote: "losers. I feel gratitude that someone saw the truth and pointed out that we don’t suffer this kind of pain because of our personal inability to get things right."
Note: its observing the self and others and noting that historically no one has been able to avoid suffering so therefore we can say its a necessary part of life. like sciece. 


Quote: "When we’re thinking that we’re competent or that we’re hopeless—what are we basing it on? On this fleeting moment? On yesterday’s success or failure? We cling to a fixed idea of who we are and it cripples us. Nothing and no one is fixed."


Quote: "It is possible to move through the drama of our lives without believing so earnestly in the character that we play."
Note: interesting people are interested people. 


Quote: "We feel justified in being annoyed with everything. We feel justified in denigrating ourselves or in feeling that we are more clever than other people. Self-importance hurts us, limiting us to the narrow world of our likes and dislikes. We end up bored to death with ourselves and our world."


Quote: "egolessness is a flexible identity. It manifests as inquisitiveness, as adaptability, as humor, as playfulness. It is our capacity to relax with not knowing,"
Note: okay yes but are you going to talk about how to practice this bodhichitta?


Quote: "If we start to move in this direction, limitless possibilities will begin to open up."


Quote: "As Suzuki Roshi put it, it is only by practicing through a continual succession of agreeable and disagreeable situations that we acquire true strength."
Note: yeah it really is not a productive use of time. 


Quote: "We waste precious time exaggerating or romanticizing or belittling ourselves with a complacent surety that yes, that’s who we are."
Note: ah so if we try to deny impermanence, egolessness, or suffering then we just needlessly cause our own suffering! because they are facts of life. 


Quote: "This teaching on the three marks of existence can motivate us to stop struggling against the nature of reality."
Note: ive had this misconception so its good to hear meditation isnt supposed to be a cure for bad emotions 


Quote: "First of all, it is helpful to understand that meditation is not just about feeling good. To think that this is why we meditate is to set ourselves up for failure."
Note: ya thats why my self improvement stint for two years felt nulified once i got to europe. 


Quote: "Does not trying to change mean we have to remain angry and addicted until the day we die? This is a reasonable question. Trying to change ourselves doesn’t work in the long run because we’re resisting our own energy. Self-improvement can have temporary results, but lasting transformation occurs only when we honor ourselves as the source of wisdom and compassion."
Note: ah hyes i neveer used to meditate whhen  felt good but i see now why thats missing the poiintt of neditation because meditation helps to see clearly the transience and rgolessness that are alwways a part of life but if  only meditate whn feling bad then i only come near this truth less than half the time. 


Quote: "We sit under all kinds of circumstances—whether we are feeling healthy or sick, whether we’re in a good mood or depressed, whether we feel our meditation is going well or is completely falling apart."


Quote: "We need self-compassion to stabilize our minds."
Note: hmmm in my next cycle f meditating ill have to see if this i true for me 


Quote: "Through the process of practicing the mindfulness-awareness technique on a regular basis, we can no longer hide from ourselves. We clearly see the barriers we set up to shield us from naked experience. Although we still associate the walls we’ve erected with safety and comfort, we also begin to feel them as a restriction."


Quote: "“Doing something different” is anything that interrupts our ancient habit of tenaciously indulging in our emotions."
Note: for me habitually i go silent, does this mean it would serve me to do something else?


Quote: "Anything that’s nonhabitual will do—even sing and dance or run around the block."


Quote: "The irony is that what we most want to avoid in our lives is crucial to awakening bodhichitta. These juicy emotional spots are where a warrior gains wisdom and compassion. Of course, we’ll want to get out of those spots far more often than we’ll want to stay. That’s why self-compassion and courage are vital."


Quote: "Particularly if they cause us to wince, we’d be wise to pay attention to their insights and criticism."


Quote: "Do we understand where the desire to lash out at another is coming from? Do we aspire not to keep going down that same old self-destructive road? Do we realize that the suffering we feel is shared by all beings?"


Quote: "So in all activities, not just sometimes when things are going well or are particularly bad, train with the bodhichitta slogans of Atisha. But remember, “Don’t try to be the fastest,” “Abandon any hope of fruition,” and “Don’t expect applause”!"

Quote: ""
Note: isnt sufferig universal? 


Quote: "May we be free from suffering and the root of suffering."
Note: limitless in what sense? 


Quote: "four limitless qualities—loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity."


Quote: "In these practices we start close to home: we express the wish that we and our loved ones enjoy happiness and be free of suffering. Then we gradually extend that aspiration to a widening circle of relationships."


Quote: "It might feel like stretching into make-believe to say, “May this person who is driving me crazy enjoy happiness and be free of suffering.” Probably what we genuinely feel is anger. This practice is like a workout that stretches the heart beyond its current capabilities. We can expect to encounter resistance. We discover that we have our limits: we can stay open to some people, but we remain closed to others. We see both our clarity and our confusion."
Note: what practices??? where are the fuckin practices??? 


Quote: "These practices unblock our love and compassion, joy and equanimity, tapping into their boundless potential to expand."

Quote: "Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they’ve been gutted by an axe. “They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that’s still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. “If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they’re fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it’s just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don’t know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they’re fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world … “And the man breaks. “He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them … but he should pity them as well.”"

Quote: "Before we begin the aspiration practice we sit quietly for a few minutes. Then we begin the seven-step loving-kindness practice. We say, “May I (or a loved one) enjoy happiness and the root of happiness,” or we put that in our own words. Perhaps we say, “May we learn to be truly loving people.” Or “May we have enough to eat and a place to sleep where we will be safe and comfortable.” After making this aspiration for ourselves and for someone we easily love, we move on to a friend. This relationship should be slightly more complicated. For example, we care for her but perhaps we also feel jealous. We say, “May Jane enjoy happiness and the root of happiness.” And we send loving-kindness her way. We can spend as much time as we want with each stage of this process, not criticizing ourselves if we sometimes find it artificial or contrived. The fourth step is to cultivate loving-kindness for a neutral person."


Quote: "The fifth step of the maitri practice is to work with a difficult person, someone we find irritating;"


Quote: "The sixth stage of the practice is called “completely dissolving the barriers.” We visualize ourselves, our beloved, a friend, a neutral person, and our current Bengali tea person—all standing in front of us. At this stage we try to connect with the feeling of kind heart for all these individuals. We"


Quote: "The seventh and final stage is to expand loving-kindness to all beings. We extend our aspiration as far as we can. We can start with those nearby and gradually widen our circle to include the neighborhood, the city, the nation, and the universe. “May all beings in the universe enjoy happiness and its causes.” This is equivalent to making the aspiration that the whole universe be at peace."

If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things—that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It’s a discipline; you have to practice it."

The first was empathy, an intimate connection with the feelings of the customer: “We will truly understand their needs better than any other company.” The second was focus: “In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.” The third and equally important principle, awkwardly named, was impute. It emphasized that people form an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it conveys."


Quote: "He belittled waitresses and frequently returned food with the proclamation that it was “garbage.”"

Quote: "Wozniak bought a dream home for himself and his new wife, but she soon divorced him and kept the house."


Quote: "At age twenty-five, he was now worth $256 million."


Quote: "But many others realized that despite his temperamental failings, Jobs had the charisma and corporate clout that would lead them to “make a dent in the universe.”"
Note: thays how i want to feel about the work i do 


Quote: "Jobs’s primary test for recruiting people in the spring of 1981 to be part of his merry band of pirates was making sure they had a passion for the product. He would sometimes bring candidates into a room where a prototype of the Mac was covered by a cloth, dramatically unveil it, and watch. “If their eyes lit up, if they went right for the mouse and started pointing and clicking, Steve would smile and hire them,” recalled Andrea Cunningham. “He wanted them to say ‘Wow!’”"


Quote: "Nietzsche, but the philosopher’s concept of the will to power and the special nature of the Überman came naturally"
Note: like keith


Quote: "He displayed another maxim: “It’s not done until it ships.”"
Note: has me wondering like in the movie "what do you do?" and i think the answer is he has the visions, he has good taste, and he can make people do what he wants. i think i have vision, taste, but instead of people power i am more adept at technical power. 


Quote: "He pulled out a bottle of mineral water and symbolically christened the prototype onstage."


Quote: "“He seemed more a showman than a businessman. Every move seemed calculated, as if it was rehearsed, to create an occasion of the moment.”"
Note: me too


Quote: "As a young executive, I was always impatient to get things done and often felt I could do them better myself."


Quote: "Jobs had always been able to draw energy by imagining himself as a rebel pitted against the forces of darkness."
Note: thats what the moroccan salesmen did to me that finally made me buy their shit?!! they used reality distortion fields!!!!! and nicolia too lol!!!!


Quote: "Jobs said that he had, an article about MTV that was “a piece of shit.” Levy replied that he had written that article. Jobs, to his credit, didn’t back away from the assessment. Instead he turned philosophical as he talked about the Macintosh."


Quote: "Apple had been more innovative, imaginative, elegant in execution, and brilliant in design. But even though Microsoft created a crudely copied series of products, it would end up winning the war of operating systems. This exposed an aesthetic flaw in how the universe worked: The best and most innovative products don’t always win."


Quote: "“The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste, they have absolutely no taste,” he said. “I don’t mean that in a small way. I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don’t think of original ideas and they don’t bring much culture into their product.”"


Quote: "The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to say, “Bye. I have to go. I’m going crazy and I’m getting out of here.” And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently."
Note: thats so random. im a computer designer looking forr work... hmmm let me call up some biologists


Quote: "Upon his return from Europe in August 1985, while he was casting about for what to do next, Jobs called the Stanford biochemist Paul Berg to discuss the advances that were being made in gene splicing and recombinant DNA."


Quote: "“What I’m best at doing is finding a group of talented people and making things with them,”"
Note: like keith. feature freeze is a good thing often enough


Quote: "Jobs made it almost impossible by continually revising the functions he wanted it to do. After a year it became clear that this would be a major source of delay."


Quote: "“He was both romantic and afraid to be romantic,” she said."
Note: thats extraverted thinking - that taste or values are objecti e


Quote: "They also had a basic philosophical difference about whether aesthetic tastes were fundamentally individual, as Redse believed, or universal and could be taught, as Jobs believed. She accused him of being too influenced by the Bauhaus movement. “Steve believed it was our job to teach people aesthetics, to teach people what they should like,” she recalled. “I don’t share that perspective. I believe when we listen deeply, both within ourselves and to each other, we are able to allow what’s innate and true to emerge.”"
Note: yes NPD is real and explains behavior of some people ive met. 


Quote: "She happened to read in a psychiatric manual about Narcissistic Personality Disorder and decided that Jobs perfectly met the criteria. “It fits so well and explained so much of what we had struggled with, that I realized expecting him to be nicer or less self-centered was like expecting a blind man to see,” she said. “It also explained some of the choices he’d made about his daughter Lisa at that time. I think the issue is empathy—the capacity for empathy is lacking.”"


Quote: "Jobs did not like to party and didn’t have a gang of male buddies. He didn’t even have a best man."

Quote: "“Engineers are taught to make a decision analytically, but there are times when relying on gut or intuition is most indispensable.”"


Quote: "And you can’t win on innovation unless you have a way to communicate to customers.”"


Quote: "The thing I’m proudest of about the iPod is that there is something about it that makes it feel significant, not disposable.”"


Quote: "We made the iPod for ourselves, and when you’re doing something for yourself, or your best friend or family, you’re not going to cheese out. If you don’t love something, you’re not going to go the extra mile, work the extra weekend, challenge the status quo as much."


Quote: "One of Jobs’s business rules was to never be afraid of cannibalizing yourself. “If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will,” he said."


Quote: "The Innovator’s Dilemma.)"


Quote: "Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they’re doing, you say ‘Wow,’ and soon you’re cooking up all sorts of ideas.”"


Quote: "Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."


Quote: "It hit me that, for young people, this whole world is the same now. When we’re making products, there is no such thing as a Turkish phone, or a music player that young people in Turkey would want that’s different from one young people elsewhere would want. We’re just one world now."


Quote: "“I’m about fifty-fifty on believing in God,” he said. “For most of my life, I’ve felt that there must be more to our existence than meets the eye.”"


Quote: "For understanding the meaning of the Shastras, one must have a well-cultivated moral sensibility, and experience in the practice of their truths. The injunction against Sudras studying the Vedas is not altogether unjustified: a Sudra, in other words, a person without moral education, without sense, and without knowledge, would completely misread the Shastras. No person, even if grown in age, is qualified to understand difficult problems in algebra without prior study. Before anyone can understand such problems, he will have needed to study the elements of the subject. How would 'Aham Brahmasmi' sound in the mouth of a lustful man? What meaning, or distorted meaning, would he not attach to it?"


Quote: "Hence, anyone who offers to interpret the Shastras must have observed the prescribed disciplines in his life. A mechanical observance of these disciplines is as futile as it is difficult."


Quote: ""Violence comes of illusion; it avails not. Non-violence alone is true." Without non-violence, it is not possible to realize truth. The vows of brahmacharya, non-stealing, and non-possession are important for the sake of non-violence, they help one to realize it in oneself. It is the life's-breath of truth. Without it, man is a beast. The seeker after truth will discover all this very early in his quest, and then he will have no difficulty at any time in understanding the meaning of the Shastras."


Quote: "Maybe Tulsidas himself, following the practice of his time, did beat his wife; so what? The practice does not cease to be reprehensible."


Quote: "It is stated in the Gita itself that everyone, whether a woman, a Vaisya or a Sudra, can acquire spiritual knowledge if they are devoted to God."


Quote: "This suggests that evil cannot by itself flourish in this world. It can do so only if it is allied with some good. This was the principle underlying non-co-operation: that the evil system which the Government represented, and which had endured only because of the support it received from good people, could not survive if that support were withdrawn."


Quote: "The Gita permits no distinction between one's relations and others."


Quote: "Mahabharata"


Quote: "It is impossible for the human body always to observe ahimsa. That is why moksha is laid down as the supreme end of life. Violence is inescapable. In everyday life and activities, such as the blinking of eyes and the paring of nails, violence of one kind or another is unavoidable. "Evil is inherent in action", the Gita says"

Quote: "used. If one's kinsmen deserve to be killed, they ought to be killed; and one must not hesitate even if the entire world were likely to be destroyed as a consequence."


Quote: "We can follow truth only in the measure that we shed our attachment to the ego."


Quote: "Shri Krishna is the atman in us, He is our charioteer. We can win only if we hand over the reins of the chariot to Him. God, like the master in a puppet show, makes us dance. We are smaller than even puppets. We should, therefore, leave everything to God, as children do to parents. Let us not eat uncooked stuff. Let Shri Krishna, the cook, prepare and give us whichever food of grace He wills for our atman."
